# 26.06.2 update guide

This guide illustrates, step by step, how to update to `26.6.2` from `26.6.1`. If you are updating from a version prior to `26.6.x`, follow the [26.06 update guide](update-26.06.md) and the [26.06.1 update guide](update-26.06.1.md) first, and apply the changes described there before continuing with this one.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Unlike previous releases, updating the** [**data-plane**](../topologies/data-plane.md) **to `26.6.2` is optional.** All the **fixes** delivered in `26.6.2` live in the operator itself, so updating the operator is enough to get all of them. You may leave `updateStrategy.autoUpdateDataPlane` set to `false` (the default) and keep your current data-plane version, avoiding a rolling update of your `MariaDB` instances.

The one exception is the new [`replication.semiSyncWaitNoSlave`](../topologies/replication.md#configuration) field. It is rendered into the server configuration by the data-plane containers, so an older data-plane silently ignores it and the setting has no effect. **If you intend to use it, the data-plane should be updated to `26.6.2`**, which implies a rolling update of the affected `MariaDB` instances. If you would rather not update the data-plane, you can set `rpl_semi_sync_master_wait_no_slave=OFF` through `spec.myCnf` instead, which works on any data-plane version.
{% endhint %}

- If you still prefer to keep the data-plane aligned with the operator version, set `updateStrategy.autoUpdateDataPlane=true` in your `MariaDB` resources before updating the operator. Then, once updated, the operator will also update the data-plane based on its version. Bear in mind that this triggers a rolling update of your `MariaDB` instances:

```diff
apiVersion: enterprise.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb-repl
spec:
  updateStrategy:
+   autoUpdateDataPlane: true
```

- Then, the CRDs must be updated to `26.6.2`:

```bash
helm repo update mariadb-enterprise-operator
helm upgrade --install mariadb-enterprise-operator-crds mariadb-enterprise-operator/mariadb-enterprise-operator-crds --version 26.6.2
```

- At this point, the operator can be updated to `26.6.2`:

```bash
helm repo update mariadb-enterprise-operator
helm upgrade --install mariadb-enterprise-operator mariadb-enterprise-operator/mariadb-enterprise-operator --version 26.6.2
```

- If you enabled `updateStrategy.autoUpdateDataPlane`, wait until the data-plane update has completed: all `MariaDB` Pods must be ready and the `MariaDB` resources must report the `Ready` condition before proceeding.

- Consider reverting `updateStrategy.autoUpdateDataPlane` back to `false` in your `MariaDB` objects to avoid unexpected updates:

```diff
apiVersion: enterprise.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb-repl
spec:
  updateStrategy:
-   autoUpdateDataPlane: true
+   autoUpdateDataPlane: false
```
