# Features

The MariaDB Enterprise MCP Server offers a comprehensive suite of tools, categorized into standard database operations, advanced vector functionalities, and workflow orchestration.

### Standard Database Operations

These tools provide fundamental control and insight into your MariaDB environment. By default, operations are read-only (`MCP_READ_ONLY = true`) but can be configured for write access (`MCP_READ_ONLY = false`).

* `list_databases`: Discovers all accessible databases.
* `list_tables`: Enumerates all tables within a specified database.
* `get_table_schema`: Retrieves the detailed schema for a specific table, including column names, data types, keys, and default values.
* `execute_sql`: Executes read-only SQL queries like `SELECT`, `SHOW`, and `DESCRIBE`. Supports parameterized queries for enhanced security.
* `create_database`: Creates a new database if it does not already exist.

### Harnessing the Power of Vectors: Advanced AI Functionality

The server’s integrated vector functionality enables semantic search and other embedding-based operations directly within your database.

#### Vector Store Management

* `create_vector_store`: Creates a new table optimized as a vector store. The schema includes columns for `id`, `document`, `embedding` (VECTOR type), and `metadata` (JSON). Users can specify the embedding model and distance function (e.g., cosine, euclidean) at creation.
* `list_vector_stores`: Lists all tables in a database that are identified as vector stores.
* `delete_vector_store`: Securely removes a vector store table.

#### Embedding and Search Operations

* `insert_docs_vector_store`: Inserts documents and associated metadata into a vector store. The server manages the generation of embeddings using a configured service.
* `search_vector_store`: Performs semantic similarity searches by generating an embedding for a user query and finding the 'k' most similar documents in the specified vector store.

### Workflow Orchestration

The server exposes powerful orchestration endpoints that allow an AI agent to execute an entire RAG pipeline through a single, secure interface.

* **Ingestion (`/orchestrate/ingestion`)**: Triggers the ingestion of documents into a specified vector store, including the chunking and embedding processes.
* **Hybrid Search (`/hybrid_search`)**: Executes a search that combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to retrieve the most relevant document chunks.
* **Generation (`/orchestrate/generation`)**: Executes a query against a set of documents, performing retrieval and generating a final, context-aware response from an LLM.
