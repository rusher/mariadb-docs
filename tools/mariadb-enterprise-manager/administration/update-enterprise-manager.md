# Update Enterprise Manager

{% hint style="info" %}
Prerequisites

* Make a backup of Enterprise Manager data following instructions in [Backup & Restore of Enterprise Manager](backup-and-restore-of-enterprise-manager.md)
{% endhint %}

## Enterprise Manager Update with Internet Access

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Login to the MariaDB Enterprise Docker Registry**

Login to the MariaDB Enterprise Docker Registry providing your [MariaDB ID](https://id.mariadb.com/) as a username and Customer Download Token as a password.

* Docker:

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"># Login
<strong>docker login docker.mariadb.com
</strong></code></pre>

* Podman:

```bash
# Login
podman login --compat-auth-file .docker/config.json docker.mariadb.com
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Download the latest installer**

{% hint style="warning" %}
This installer performs an in-place update of an existing Enterprise Manager deployment. Download and run it in the directory that contains the existing deployment’s `enterprise-manager/` installation directory.
{% endhint %}

Insert your Customer Download Token into the download URL and download the latest installer in the same folder where you have folder `enterprise-manager`:

```bash
# Download installer
wget https://dlm.mariadb.com/<Customer_Download_Token>/enterprise-release-helpers/install-enterprise-manager.sh
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Make the installer executable**

{% code title="# Make executable" %}
```bash
chmod +x install-enterprise-manager.sh
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Run the installer**

Update Enterprise Manager by running the installer:

{% code title="# Run installer" %}
```bash
./install-enterprise-manager.sh
```
{% endcode %}

During this step, the installer renames the existing `enterprise-manager/` directory to `enterprise-manager.old/`, downloads and extracts the new installation tarball into a new `enterprise-manager/` directory, and copies the existing `.env` file and TLS certificates from `enterprise-manager.old/` to preserve the current configuration. It then pulls the required container images and recreates the Enterprise Manager containers while reusing the existing container volumes.

When the update completes successfully, the message `Enterprise Manager has been upgraded` is displayed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Verify containers**

Run `docker compose ps` in the `enterprise-manager` directory to check that all of the constituent containers are running. The containers are:

* `enterprise-manager-grafana`
* `enterprise-manager-nginx`
* `enterprise-manager-otelcol`
* `enterprise-manager-prometheus`
* `enterprise-manager-supermax`

{% code title="# Check containers" %}
```bash
cd enterprise-manager
docker compose ps
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Enterprise Manager Update in Air-Gapped Deployment

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Copy new installer tarball and container images to a private registry**

Copy the new installer tarball and container images to your private registry, exactly as during [installation](deployment/installing-mariadb-enterprise-manager/#staging-host), using the versions from the [Enterprise Manager release notes]({release-notes}/enterprise-manager) for the target release.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Update the image versions**

Edit the existing `enterprise-manager/.env` file and update each `IMAGE_*` tag to the new version of container image you copied to your private registry in the previous step.

{% code title="# Update image version in .env file" %}
```bash
IMAGE_SUPERMAX=<private-registry>/mariadb/enterprise-manager-backend:<backend-version>
IMAGE_NGINX=<private-registry>/mariadb/enterprise-manager-frontend:<frontend-version>
IMAGE_GRAFANA=<private-registry>/mariadb/grafana:<grafana-version>
IMAGE_PROMETHEUS=<private-registry>/mariadb/prometheus:<prometheus-version>
IMAGE_OTELCOL=<private-registry>/mariadb/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:<otelcol-version>
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Download the latest installer**

{% hint style="warning" %}
This installer performs an in-place update of an existing Enterprise Manager deployment. Download and run it in the directory that contains the existing deployment’s `enterprise-manager/` installation directory.
{% endhint %}

Download the latest version of installer, place it on the Enterprise Manager host in the same folder where you have folder `enterprise-manager`. Make it executable.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Run the installer**

Update Enterprise Manager by running the installer:

{% code title="# Run installer" %}
```bash
./install-enterprise-manager.sh \
  --registry <private-registry> \
  --repository mariadb/enterprise-manager-distrib \
  --tag <release-version>
```
{% endcode %}

The flags tell the installer where to pull the new installation tarball from:

* `--registry` — your private registry hostname or IP address.
* `--repository` — the path to the tarball within your registry.
* `--tag` — the Enterprise Manager release version.

During this step, the installer renames the existing `enterprise-manager/` directory to `enterprise-manager.old/`, downloads and extracts the new installation tarball into a new `enterprise-manager/` directory, and copies the existing `.env` file and TLS certificates from `enterprise-manager.old/` to preserve the current configuration. It then pulls the required container images and recreates the Enterprise Manager containers while reusing the existing container volumes.

When the update completes successfully, the message `Enterprise Manager has been upgraded` is displayed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Verify containers**

Run `docker compose ps` in the `enterprise-manager` directory to check that all of the constituent containers are running. The containers are:

* `enterprise-manager-grafana`
* `enterprise-manager-nginx`
* `enterprise-manager-otelcol`
* `enterprise-manager-prometheus`
* `enterprise-manager-supermax`

{% code title="# Check containers" %}
```bash
cd enterprise-manager
docker compose ps
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Agent update <a href="#agent-update" id="agent-update"></a>

Update the `mema-agent` package on each monitored MariaDB Server and MaxScale node using the node's package manager. On air-gapped nodes, you can download the new package from the [MariaDB Customer Downloads page](https://mariadb.com/downloads/enterprise-tooling/enterprise-manager/), transfer it to the node, and update it locally. After updating, verify that the host continues to report to MariaDB Enterprise Manager.
