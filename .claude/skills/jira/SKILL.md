# jira (MariaDB DOCS)

Shared logic for the MariaDB documentation Jira workflow. The granular slash commands
(`/jira-start`, `/jira-create`, `/jira-resolve`, `/jira-close`, `/jira-comment`, `/jira-mine`)
each delegate here so the connection check, project config, and field/transition rules live in
**one** place. Full conventions: `dev-docs/cookbook-jira-workflow.md`.

## Configuration (this instance)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| MCP server | **`atlassian-mariadb`** (tools are `mcp__atlassian-mariadb__*`) |
| cloudId | `164b0d33-ee39-4b4d-b1d5-e71a97376560` (site `mariadbcorp.atlassian.net`) |
| Project key | `DOCS` (project id `10037`, **team-managed**) |
| Issue types | **Task** (`10083`, default), Epic (`11292`), Subtask (`10280`) — no Bug/Improvement |
| Priority | defaults to **Major** (`10003`) |

> The MariaDB site is reached through a **second** Rovo MCP connection (`atlassian-mariadb`),
> separate from the GridGain one. Always use the `mcp__atlassian-mariadb__*` tools here — never
> `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian_Rovo__*` (that's GridGain) — or you'll hit the wrong instance.

### Workflow transitions (verified 2026-06-12)

All transitions are **global** (available from any status) and have **no required screen** —
so a transition call needs no extra fields. Discover live and **match by name** (ids are stable
but trust the live list):

| Action | Transition name | id | → status (category) |
|--------|-----------------|----|---------------------|
| Begin work | `IN PROGRESS` | 21 | In Progress |
| Hand off for review | `Review` | 2 | In Progress (Review) |
| Finish | `Closed` | 31 | Done |
| Park | `On Hold` | 6 | To Do |
| Need input | `Needs Feedback` | 5 | To Do |
| Reset | `TODO` | 11 | To Do |
| Drop | `CANCELED` / `DUPLICATED` | 3 / 4 | Done |

### Create fields (Task)

Only **`summary`** is required (plus `project`). `priority` defaults to Major. **No
components, no fix versions, no mandatory custom fields.** Optional: `description`, `priority`,
`labels`, and assignee (set via the `assignee_account_id` param). A Sprint field
(`customfield_10021`) exists but is a team-managed board field — don't set it on create (it
usually 400s); add the sprint from the board afterward.

## Setup — verify the MariaDB Rovo connection (MANDATORY, run first)

The **authoritative** check is the accessible-resources call (not `claude mcp list`, whose
output format is version-dependent and easy to misparse):

```
mcp__atlassian-mariadb__getAccessibleAtlassianResources()
```

The result **must** contain `mariadbcorp.atlassian.net` (cloudId `164b0d33-…`). If that call
errors (server not connected) or returns a result **without** `mariadbcorp`, stop. (`claude mcp
list` is fine as an optional human diagnostic, but a parse of its output must never gate the
work — only the resource call above does.)

If it shows only `ggsystems`, the second connection got bound to the GridGain account — tell the
user:

> The `atlassian-mariadb` MCP is authenticated as the wrong account (GridGain). Re-auth it under
> your MariaDB account: in a browser signed in to `mariadbcorp.atlassian.net`, run `/mcp` →
> `atlassian-mariadb` → log out → re-authenticate. Then retry.

If the server is missing entirely, point the user at `dev-docs/cookbook-jira-workflow.md` ›
*Connecting the MariaDB Jira*. Do not proceed with any Jira call until the resource check passes.

Every Rovo call below takes `cloudId="164b0d33-ee39-4b4d-b1d5-e71a97376560"`.

## Procedure: START (`/jira-start DOCS-XXXX`)

Begin work on a ticket: create a feature branch and move it to IN PROGRESS.

1. **Resolve the key.** Accept `DOCS-XXXX` or a `mariadbcorp.atlassian.net/browse/DOCS-XXXX`
   URL. If absent, ask.
2. **Fetch the ticket** — `getJiraIssue(cloudId, issueIdOrKey="DOCS-XXXX")`. Display summary,
   issue type, status, assignee. If already `Closed`/`CANCELED`/`DUPLICATED`, say so and ask
   before reopening.
3. **Assign to the current user if unassigned** — `me = atlassianUserInfo()`, then
   `editJiraIssue(..., fields={"assignee": {"accountId": me.account_id}})`.
4. **Branch.** Check the current branch:
   ```bash
   current_branch="$(git branch --show-current)"
   ```
   - If it already matches `^DOCS-XXXX-`, reuse it (skip creation).
   - Else derive a short kebab-case slug from the summary, **confirm the branch name with the
     user**, and cut it from latest main:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin main
     git checkout -b DOCS-XXXX-short-slug --no-track origin/main
     ```
     `--no-track` prevents a bare `git push` from targeting main; first push uses
     `git push -u origin DOCS-XXXX-short-slug`.
5. **Transition to IN PROGRESS** if not already there — fetch live transitions, pick the one
   named `IN PROGRESS` (id 21), `transitionJiraIssue(..., transition={"id": "<id>"})`. No extra
   fields needed.
6. **Confirm**: `Ticket / Type / Branch / Status: In Progress`.
7. Suggest running **`doc-from-ticket DOCS-XXXX`** next to draft the verified edit.

## Procedure: CREATE (`/jira-create <description>`)

File a new DOCS ticket. Because the project requires only `summary`, this is light.

1. **Issue type** — default **Task**; use **Epic** only if the user types `epic`. (No Bug type
   exists.) Never ask; narrate the resolved value.
2. **Summary** — one sentence; derive from the description, confirm with the user.
3. **Priority** — default **Major**; override only if the user signals urgency
   (`blocker`/`critical`/`minor`/`trivial` map to the named priorities).
4. **Create:**
   ```
   createJiraIssue(
     cloudId="164b0d33-ee39-4b4d-b1d5-e71a97376560",
     projectKey="DOCS",
     issueTypeName="Task",
     summary="<summary>",
     description="<Markdown body>",
     contentFormat="markdown"
   )
   ```
   - **Assignee:** set via the tool's top-level `assignee_account_id` param (e.g. the current
     user from `atlassianUserInfo()`), **not** via `additional_fields`.
   - **Priority / labels:** only add to `additional_fields` when the user asked.
   - **Sprint:** do **not** set on create. `customfield_10021` is a team-managed board field and
     setting it at create time typically fails (400) unless the issue is already on the active
     sprint — assign the sprint from the board afterward if needed.
   - If any field id is rejected, run `getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields(cloudId, projectIdOrKey="DOCS", issueTypeId="10083")` and use the live id.
5. **Confirm**: `Ticket / Type / Priority / URL`.

## Procedure: RESOLVE (`/jira-resolve DOCS-XXXX`) — hand off for review

Use when the doc PR is open and ready for editorial review. Moves the ticket to **Review**
(NOT Closed — the reviewer closes it after merge; see `/jira-close`).

1. **Resolve the key.** Use the argument if given. Otherwise extract it from the current branch
   — match the **first** `DOCS-<digits>` token, case-insensitively, **anywhere** in the name
   (handles `DOCS-1234-slug`, `feature/DOCS-1234`, `docs-1234-x`):
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current | grep -oiE 'DOCS-[0-9]+' | head -1
   ```
   Uppercase the result. If nothing matches, ask the user for the key.
2. **Fetch the ticket**; if already `Review`/`Closed`, stop (idempotent).
3. **Find the PR link.** Prefer the PR for the current branch
   (`gh pr view --json url -q .url` if `gh` is available), else the merge/commit:
   ```bash
   git log origin/main --oneline --grep="DOCS-XXXX" -1
   ```
   If none found, ask the user for the PR URL.
4. **Comment with the PR/commit link** (Markdown):
   ```
   addCommentToJiraIssue(cloudId, issueIdOrKey="DOCS-XXXX",
     commentBody="Docs PR: [<repo>#<n>](<pr-url>)", contentFormat="markdown")
   ```
   `contentFormat="markdown"` is required or links render as literal text.
5. **Transition to `Review`** (id 2) — fetch live transitions, match by name.
6. **Confirm**: `Ticket / Status: Review / PR link`.

## Procedure: CLOSE (`/jira-close DOCS-XXXX`) — final step after merge

1. Resolve key (arg, or extract from the branch as in RESOLVE step 1); fetch ticket. If already
   `Closed`, stop.
2. Confirm the PR is merged (ask if unsure — don't close unmerged work).
3. **Transition to `Closed`** (id 31), match by name.
4. Optionally comment with the merge commit. Confirm: `Ticket / Status: Closed`.

## Procedure: COMMENT (`/jira-comment DOCS-XXXX <text>`)

`addCommentToJiraIssue(cloudId, issueIdOrKey, commentBody="<text>", contentFormat="markdown")`.
Always pass `contentFormat="markdown"`. Echo back the ticket + a one-line confirmation.

## Procedure: MINE (`/jira-mine`)

List the current user's open DOCS tickets:

```
me = atlassianUserInfo()
searchJiraIssuesUsingJql(
  cloudId="164b0d33-ee39-4b4d-b1d5-e71a97376560",
  jql="project = DOCS AND assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY updated DESC",
  fields=["key","summary","status","priority","updated"],
  maxResults=50
)
```

Print a compact table: key · status · summary. If the user passes a filter word (e.g. a status
or `inprogress`), add it to the JQL.

**Surface the scope:** this shows only tickets **assigned to you**. Many DOCS tickets —
especially auto-generated `[Auto] Documentation needed` ones — are **unassigned** or owned by
the docs lead, so an empty result doesn't mean "no work." Mention this, and offer a broader view
on request, e.g. unassigned open tickets:
`project = DOCS AND assignee IS EMPTY AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY updated DESC`.

## Guardrails

- **MariaDB instance only.** Use `mcp__atlassian-mariadb__*` + cloudId `164b0d33-…`. Never the
  GridGain Rovo tools.
- **Never `git push`, commit, or open a PR as a side effect** of a Jira command unless the user
  explicitly asked — these commands manage *Jira state and the branch*, not your commits.
- **Match transitions by name** against the live `getTransitionsForJiraIssue` list; the ids here
  are documented hints, not guarantees.
- **Idempotent**: re-running start/resolve/close on a ticket already in the target state is a
  no-op with a clear message, not an error.
- When delegating from another skill (e.g. `doc-from-ticket` suggests starting a ticket), follow
  the relevant procedure above verbatim.
