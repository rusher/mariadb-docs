# CI (.github/workflows/codespell.yml and link-check-pr.yml), plus four checks it delegates to
# their own scripts: a GitBook include resolver (includecheck.sh, gated in CI by
# includecheck-pr.yml since DOCS-6586), a heading-anchor gate (fragcheck.py, gated by
# fragcheck-pr.yml), an orphaned-page/nav-coverage gate and a net line-loss guard — the last

# The pre-commit hook, the /precommit command, the docs-check skill, and dev-docs/cookbook-pre-pr.md

# one place. If CI changes its codespell flags or lychee excludes, update THIS file only.

#          1 = a real failure (misspelling, broken link, unresolvable include, or a heading

# --- GitBook include resolver — HAS a CI counterpart since DOCS-6586 ------------------------
# The resolver itself now lives in .claude/hooks/includecheck.sh, which is also what
# .github/workflows/includecheck-pr.yml runs; that header carries the full rationale. It was
# extracted rather than duplicated because routing the workflow through THIS script would have
# dragged in the checks either side of it — codespell and lychee, which have their own
# workflows, and the orphan guard, which is still waiting on DOCS-6586's acknowledgment-path
# decision and has no skip flag to hold it back with.
#
# Needs no external tool, so unlike every other check here it can never be SKIPPED. The one
# difference between the two callers is scope, and it is deliberate: this passes the caller's
# files (a pre-commit hook has no business scanning 9,700 pages), while CI runs the whole tree,
# because deleting one shared target breaks every page that includes it and a changed-files
# check cannot see those pages. Measured: removing platform/.gitbook/includes/most-recent-10.11.md
# breaks 20 post-download pages the commit never touches.
# Resolved relative to THIS script, not the working directory. The two are the same in every
# real invocation (both CI and the hooks run from the repo root), but they are not the same in
# doc-lint-test.sh, which runs this script from the repo while CWD is a throwaway sandbox. A
# CWD-relative path would have made the resolver unreachable there — i.e. the six include cases
# would have gone on passing while testing the "script missing" branch instead of the resolver.
# The other two delegated scripts are deliberately left CWD-relative: the suite depends on their
# being absent to exercise their SKIP branches.

# --- GitBook heading anchors — NO CI counterpart --------------------------------------------
# A link to `page.md#some-heading` can rot in two ways that every other gate here is blind
# to: the heading is renamed, or the anchor was hand-written in the wrong dialect. CI passes
# no `--include-fragments`, and enabling it would not help — lychee's slugger is
# GitHub-flavoured, so on this repo it is wrong in BOTH directions: 386 of its 1,129 fragment
# errors are false positives (the anchor resolves live), and it misses 213 anchors that really
# are dead. `.claude/hooks/fragcheck.py` implements GitBook's rules instead, validated at
# 4,599/4,599 anchors against the rendered pages (DOCS-6491).
#
# It also gates a third rot that no link checker can see at all — including fragcheck itself
# when it is only looking for dead anchors. A heading line duplicated for a new section keeps
# the original's `<a href="#x" id="x">`, GitBook honours the explicit id over the text slug, and
# the two sections then share one anchor: the second dedupes to `-1` and neither owns the anchor
# a reader expects. Every link still resolves, just to the wrong section, so this is a semantic
# mismatch rather than a broken link (DOCS-6492). A heading whose explicit id is a deliberate
# historical KB alias for its own text is NOT flagged — only an id that belongs to a different
# heading on the same page. That distinction is the whole check: 48 headings differ from their
# text slug, but only 8 were defects, so flagging the wide class would be a 6x overstatement.
#
# Two deliberate design choices:
#   1. It reports only anchors that are dead NOW but resolved at $LINT_BASE. The repo carries
#      ~1,272 pre-existing dead anchors, so a plain check would turn every unrelated PR red on
#      breakage it did not introduce (the `broken-reference` trap — see the lychee section). The
#      stolen-id class is diffed against $LINT_BASE for the same reason: it stands at 0 today,
#      but this repo is also edited from the GitBook UI, so an absolute check would fail
#      unrelated PRs the moment a GITBOOK-* commit introduced one case.
#   2. It scans the whole tree, not just "${files[@]}". Renaming a heading breaks inbound links
#      from pages the commit never touched, and a changed-files check cannot see those. The two
#      passes cost ~14s; set DOC_LINT_SKIP_FRAGMENTS=1 to skip when iterating.
#
# Needs python3 (no third-party modules) and a git work tree; missing either is a SKIP, and a
# base revision that cannot be checked out is a SKIP too — never a silent pass into failure.

# --- orphaned pages (nav coverage) — NO CI counterpart --------------------------------------

# never renders, and NOTHING else here can see it: the markup is valid so codespell passes, the
# links resolve so lychee passes, and the page is simply never built. There is no failing signal
# anywhere — the only symptom is a reader reporting a missing page.
#
# DOCS-6566 is the case. dde0fb263 added four post-download pages (Server 12.3.3, 11.8.9,
# 11.4.13, 10.11.19) and bumped their most-recent-*.md includes, but never touched
# platform/SUMMARY.md; all four sat unpublished for eight days until a reader noticed, with every
# gate green throughout. Replayed against dde0fb263, navcheck names all four and exits 1.
#
# Like the anchor gate above, it is diffed against $LINT_BASE and for the same reason: main
# carries 219 pre-existing orphans (190 in server alone), so an absolute check would fail every
# unrelated PR on breakage it did not introduce. It reports only pages newly orphaned — added
# with no nav entry, or de-listed while the file survives.
#
# Unlike that gate this needs no worktree (the base side is read with git ls-tree / git show), so
# it costs milliseconds and has no skip flag. A deliberately unlisted page is legitimate: name it
# in DOC_LINT_ALLOW_ORPHAN (space/comma-separated, or "all") and say why in the commit message.

# Needs python3 (no third-party modules) and a git work tree; missing either is a SKIP, as is a

# --- net line-loss guard — NO CI counterpart ------------------------------------------------
# Catches the "silently gutted page" failure: a surviving page loses most of its body while the
# markup stays valid and every remaining link resolves, so codespell and lychee both PASS.
#
# DOCS-6442 is the case this exists for. A retirement campaign (DOCS-5976 Tier B, c6ea5549a)
# meant to delete ONE {% columns %} content-ref block from the Storage Engines landing page —
# the block pointing at a folder it was removing — and promote FEDERATED into its place. It
# deleted 23 of the 24 blocks instead: 298 lines -> 22, 24 content-refs -> 1. SUMMARY.md was
# untouched, so the nav still listed all 27 engines while the page listed one. Every gate passed;
# a reader found it two days later, and b36d939 rebuilt the page from SUMMARY.md.
#
# The metric is NET loss (pre - post, i.e. deletions minus additions), not raw deletions.
# Raw deletions flag every reformatting campaign — alias expansion, trailing-backslash removal,
# changelog normalization — because those rewrite lines rather than remove them. Measured over
# 300 commits of this repo: raw deletions >40% flags 17 files (mostly those campaigns), net loss
# >40% flags 4. On c6ea5549a itself the guard yields a ONE-item list at 94%, next-worst 16%.
#
# Thresholds and the acknowledgment path are env-overridable:
#   DOC_LINT_SHRINK_PCT   (40) percent of the pre-image lost, net, before flagging
#   DOC_LINT_SHRINK_MIN   (20) minimum net lines lost, so tiny files can't trip it
#   DOC_LINT_SHRINK_FLOOR (30) minimum pre-image size considered at all
#   DOC_LINT_BASE       (HEAD) revision the pre-image is read from
#   DOC_LINT_ALLOW_SHRINK     space/comma-separated paths to exempt, or "all"
#
# A deliberate large shrink is legitimate (Tier C's Debian README correctly went 70 -> 34 lines
# when three of its five children were retired), so this gate is meant to be acknowledged, not
# worked around: name the path in DOC_LINT_ALLOW_SHRINK and say why in the commit message.
