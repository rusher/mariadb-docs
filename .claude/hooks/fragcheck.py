"""fragcheck.py — GitBook-accurate heading-anchor (#fragment) checker.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    lychee's --include-fragments uses a GitHub-flavoured slugger that diverges
    from GitBook's, so on this repo it is wrong in BOTH directions: measured on
    main (DOCS-6491, 2026-08-21) it reported 1,129 fragment errors of which 386
    were false positives (the anchor resolves on the live site), while missing
    213 anchors that really are dead. That is why link-check-pr.yml passes no
    --include-fragments, and why turning it on there would not help.

    This implements GitBook's rules instead. `validate` re-derives them from the
    rendered pages, so they stay checkable rather than folkloric.

WHICH HEADINGS PUBLISH AN ANCHOR:  h2, h3 and h4 ONLY  (DOCS-6503)
    h1 is the page title. h5 and h6 render as <p><strong class="font-bold">...</strong>
    </p> with no id at all -- grep '<h5' on any rendered page returns 0. Crediting
    them made this checker wrong in the OPTIMISTIC direction: it computed an anchor
    that does not exist, so a link to it was reported as resolving while the reader
    lands at the top of the page. Such a link is now reported as
    [unanchored-heading]; the honest repair is to raise the heading to h4, or to
    retarget the link at the enclosing section -- never to promote a bold paragraph
    to "#####", which reads as a fix and repairs nothing.

HEADINGS ARE NOT THE ONLY ANCHOR SOURCE:  {% tab title="..." %}  (DOCS-6451)
    GitBook gives every tab panel id="<slug of the title>" (and its button
    id="tab-<slug>"), using the same slug rules as a heading and drawing from the
    SAME per-page id namespace, in document order. So a tab and a heading that slug
    alike are de-duplicated against each other, not separately. Proven on
    server/reference/sql-statements/data-definition/atomic-ddl.md, where the tab
    titled "Background" (line 15) publishes id="background" and the later
    "## Background" (line 30) is pushed to id="background-1" -- both read off the
    rendered page. 927 tab titles across the tree.

    Crediting them makes the checker wrong in the PESSIMISTIC direction if omitted:
    a link to a tab anchor resolves for the reader while the checker calls it dead.
    That is how this was found -- a cross-space link to
    mariadb-package-repository-setup-and-usage#mariadb_es_repo_setup was reported
    as a dead anchor, and the anchor is on the live page, published by a tab.
    A bare {% tab %} with no title publishes nothing addressable (3 in the tree),
    so it contributes no anchor.

THE SLUG RULES  (each derived from a rendered id="..." on mariadb.com/docs)
    * lowercase; dots and underscores survive
    * an explicit <a ... id="x"> inside the heading line WINS over the text slug
      (KB-migration debris, and GitBook honours it) -- an id="..." in prose does not
    * HTML entities are decoded FIRST, so a trailing "&#x20;" is a space and not an
      "&" to be spelled out (columnstore_cache_use_import&#x20; -> ..._import)
    * a footnote reference in the heading contributes nothing:
      "EITS[^1] vs. InnoDB Statistics" -> eits-vs.-innodb-statistics
    * a trailing kramdown "{#id}" is removed from the text
    * CHARMAP characters are spelled out rather than collapsed to a dash:
      & -> and, | -> or, > -> greater-than, < -> less-than, $ -> usd
      ("$type" -> usdtype, "Accumulators ($group)" -> accumulators-usdgroup),
      U+00AE -> -r- ("MongoDB(R) Shell" -> mongodb-r-shell)
    * apostrophes vanish leaving no dash (Node's -> nodes)
    * every other run of non-word characters collapses to one dash
      (TLS/SSL -> tls-ssl, "(options) -> PoolCluster" -> options-greater-than-poolcluster)
    * "+" vanishes AFTER that collapse, so it leaves its two dashes behind:
      "5.3.2 + MyISAM" -> "5.3.2--myisam" (then id- prefixed, being digit-led),
      while "x--an Imperfect Solution"
      (a literal double dash, one separator run) -> "x-an-imperfect-solution"
    * leading/trailing "-" and trailing "." / "_" are trimmed
    * a digit-leading slug is prefixed "id-" (2_DIGIT_YEAR -> id-2_digit_year)
    * the slug is truncated to 100 characters
    * duplicate slugs get -1, -2, ... in document order

    Validated at 4,599/4,599 computed anchors over 99 pages (47 sampled at
    random, 45 chosen for punctuation density, 7 used to derive the rules) -- and
    that sample, picked for punctuation DENSITY, happened to contain no h5, no "$"
    and no "(R)", which is how five rule gaps survived it (DOCS-6503). The second
    sweep picked pages for STRUCTURAL variety instead: every character that occurs
    in a heading anywhere in the repo and is not a plain ASCII word character, two
    pages each -- 33 pages, 1,317 anchors. Whatever GitBook transliterates that
    CHARMAP does not cover is REPORTED rather than guessed at; see unmappable().

MODES
    fragcheck.py check [path ...]        dead anchors under each path (default: repo)
    fragcheck.py new <rev> [path ...]    only what <rev> had fine -- the gate
    fragcheck.py ids [path ...]          headings publishing another heading's anchor
    fragcheck.py risky [path ...]        headings whose computed anchor is a guess
    fragcheck.py anchors <file.md>       the anchors one file publishes
    fragcheck.py validate <file.md> ...  compare computed anchors to the live page

`new` is what doc-lint.sh calls. It scans the whole tree twice (once here, once in
a throwaway worktree at <rev>) and reports only the difference, so the repo's
pre-existing dead anchors stay out of the way while a heading rename that breaks
inbound links from untouched pages still fails. It gates two classes:

    * anchors that <rev> resolved and the working tree does not (a rename)
    * headings that took over another heading's explicit id (`ids`, DOCS-6492) --
      invisible to every link checker, this one included, because the anchors all
      exist and resolve; they just land on the wrong section
