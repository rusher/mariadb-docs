# /jira-resolve

Run the **RESOLVE** procedure in `.claude/skills/jira/SKILL.md` for `$ARGUMENTS`.

- Run the skill's **Setup** connection check first.
- Resolve the key from the argument, or infer it from the current branch's `DOCS-XXXX` prefix.
- Stop if the ticket is already in Review/Closed (idempotent).
- Find the PR link (`gh pr view` or the `DOCS-XXXX` commit on `origin/main`); ask if none found.
- Post **one combined Markdown comment**: the `**Docs PR:**` link pinned at the top, then the
  **fact-check report** (found by key under `reports_dir`, grouped by space:
  `<space>/DOCS-XXXX/report.md`) below a `---` divider if it exists. Keeping the link at the top of
  a single comment stops the long report from pushing it out of sight. Set the report's `Status:`
  to `handed-off` and regen `INDEX.md`; warn (and ask) if the doc ticket has no report (still post
  the PR-link line in that case).
- Transition to **`Review`** (match by name). This does **not** close the ticket — the reviewer
  runs `/jira-close` after merge.
- Confirm with `Ticket / Status: Review / PR link / report posted`.
