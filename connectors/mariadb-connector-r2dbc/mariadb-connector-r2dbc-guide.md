## About MariaDB Connector/R2DBC

## Overview

Java developers can use MariaDB Connector/R2DBC to connect to MariaDB database products using the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) API. R2DBC operations are non-blocking, which makes the R2DBC API more scalable than Java's standard JDBC API. MariaDB Connector/R2DBC has a native R2DBC implementation and the Spring Data R2DBC framework.

## End-of-Life (EOL) Versions

The following versions of MariaDB Connector/R2DBC have reached the End of Life and are no longer supported:

* MariaDB Connector/R2DBC 1.0
* MariaDB Connector/R2DBC 1.1

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the next available supported version.

## Maven artifacts

Current connector supporting 1.0.0 R2DBC spec is:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb</groupId>
    <artifactId>r2dbc-mariadb</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.x</version>
</dependency>
```

To support R2DBC 0.9.1 spec that is incompatible with 1.0.0 spec:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb</groupId>
    <artifactId>r2dbc-mariadb-0.9.1-spec</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.x</version>
</dependency>
```

## Benefits of R2DBC

The R2DBC API relies on reactive data streams, which provide many benefits over standard JDBC:

* Reactive: R2DBC uses an event-driven, non-blocking, and functional programming model.
* Scalable: R2DBC is more scalable than standard JDBC because it allows the runtime to handle concurrency and scheduling.
* Fast: R2DBC streams results, which can improve performance.
* Efficient: R2DBC uses deferred execution and flow control to ensure its operations are performed efficiently.
* Simple: R2DBC is designed to make common usage patterns simple to implement for developers.
