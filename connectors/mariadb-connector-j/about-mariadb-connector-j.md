MariaDB Connector/J is used to connect applications developed in Java to\
MariaDB and MySQL databases using the standard JDBC API. The library is LGPL\
licensed.

MariaDB Connector/J is a Type 4 JDBC driver. It was developed specifically as\
a lightweight JDBC connector for use with MariaDB and MySQL database servers.\
It was originally based on the Drizzle JDBC code with numerous additions and\
bug fixes.

#### Server Compatibility

MariaDB Connector/J is compatible with all MariaDB and MySQL server versions.

{% hint style="info" %}
MariaDB Connector/J releases older than 1.2.0 may be compatible with server versions older than MySQL 5.5, but those MariaDB Connector/J releases aren't supported anymore.
{% endhint %}

#### Java Compatibility

## Installing MariaDB Connector/J

MariaDB Connector/J can be installed using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), or by manually putting the `.jar` file in your [CLASSPATH](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html). See [Installing MariaDB Connector/J](installing-mariadb-connectorj.md) for more information.

MariaDB Connector/J `.jar` files and source code tarballs can be downloaded from the following URL:

*

MariaDB Connector/J `.jar` files can also be downloaded from the following URL:

* [#connectors](https://mariadb.com/downloads/#connectors)

#### Installing Dependencies

JNA (net.java.dev.jna:jna) and JNA-PLATFORM (net.java.dev.jna:jna-platform) 4.2.1 or greater are also needed when you would like to connect to the server with Unix sockets or windows pipes.

## Using the Driver

The following subsections show the formatting of JDBC connection strings for\
MariaDB and MySQL database servers. Additionally, sample code is provided that\
demonstrates how to connect to one of these servers and create a table.

### Getting a New Connection

There are two standard ways to get a connection:

**Using DriverManager**

The preferred way to get a connection with MariaDB Connector/J is to use the [DriverManager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/DriverManager.html) class.\
When the `DriverManager` class is used to locate and load MariaDB Connector/J, the application needs no further configuration. The `DriverManager` class will automatically load MariaDB Connector/J and allow it to be used in the same way as any other JDBC driver.

For example:

```java
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/DB?user=root&password=myPassword");
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The legacy way of loading a JDBC driver also still works for MariaDB Connector/J. e.g.: `Class.forName("org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver")`
{% endhint %}

**jdbc:mysql scheme compatibility**

MariaDB Connector/J 3.0 only accepts `jdbc:mariadb:` as the protocol in connection strings by default. When both MariaDB Connector/J and the MySQL drivers are found in the class-path, using `jdbc:mariadb:` as the protocol helps to ensure that Java chooses MariaDB Connector/J.

Connector/J still allows `jdbc:mysql:` as the protocol in connection strings when the `permitMysqlScheme` option is set. For example:

`jdbc:mysql://HOST/DATABASE?permitMysqlScheme`

(2.x version did permit connection URLs beginning with both `jdbc:mariadb` and `jdbc:mysql`)

**Using a Pool**

Another way to get a connection with MariaDB Connector/J is to use a connection pool.

MariaDB Connector/J provides 2 different Datasource pool implementations:

* `MariaDbDataSource`: The basic implementation. It creates a new connection each time the `getConnection()` method is called.
* `MariaDbPoolDataSource`: A connection pool implementation. It maintains a pool of connections, and when a new connection is requested, one is borrowed from the pool.

**Internal Pool**

The driver's internal pool configuration provides a very fast pool implementation and deals with the issues most of the java pool have:

* 2 different connection states cleaning after release
* deals with non-activity (connections in the pool will be released if not used after some time, avoiding the issue created when the server closes the connection after @wait\_timeout is reached).

See the [pool documentation](pool-datasource-implementation.md) for more information.

**External pool**

When using an external connection pool, the MariaDB Driver class `org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver` must be configured.

Example using hikariCP JDBC connection pool :

```java
final HikariDataSource ds = new HikariDataSource();
        ds.setMaximumPoolSize(20);
        ds.setDriverClassName("org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver");
        ds.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/db");
        ds.addDataSourceProperty("user", "root");
        ds.addDataSourceProperty("password", "myPassword");
        ds.setAutoCommit(false);
```

Please note that the driver class provided by MariaDB Connector/J **is not `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver` but `org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver`**!

The `org.mariadb.jdbc.MariaDbDataSource` class can be used when the pool datasource configuration only permits the java.sql.Datasource implementation.

#### Connection Strings

The format of the JDBC connection string is:

```java
jdbc:mariadb:[replication:|loadbalance:|sequential:|load-balance-read:]//<hostDescription>[,<hostDescription>...]/[database][?<key1>=<value1>[&<key2>=<value2>]]
```

HostDescription:

```java
<host>[:<portnumber>]  or address=(host=<host>|localSocket=<socket>|pipe=<namedpipe>)[(port=<portnumber>)][(type=(master|replica|slave))][(sslMode=disable|trust|verify-ca|verify-full)]
```

Some notes about this:

* The host must be a DNS name or IP address.
* If the host is an IPv6 address, then it must be inside square brackets.
* The default port is `3306`.
* The default type is `master`.
* If the failover and load-balancing mode is set to `replication`, then the connector assumes that the first host is master, and the others are replicas by default, if their types are not explicitly mentioned.
* aurora failover prefix is available on 2.x version.
* A detailed host description option supersedes a global option description
* sslMode, pipe and localSocket are available since 3.4.1 version

Examples:

* `localhost:3306`
* `[2001:0660:7401:0200:0000:0000:0edf:bdd7]:3306`
* `somehost.com:3306`
* `address=(host=localhost)(port=3306)(type=master)`

The `jdbc:mariadb:sequential:address=(localSocket=/socket)(sslMode=disable),10.0.0.1:3306/DB?sslMode=verify-full` connection string will permit to connect to local unix socket if available, or to host 10.0.0.1 using SSL if not.

#### Failover and Load-Balancing Modes

Failover and Load-Balancing Modes were introduced in [MariaDB Connector/J 1.2.0.](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/connectors/java/mariadb-connector-j-12-release-notes/mariadb-connector-j-120-release-notes)

**`sequential`**

* Description: This mode supports connection failover in a multi-master environment, such as MariaDB Galera Cluster. This mode does not support load-balancing reads on replicas. The connector will try to connect to hosts in the order in which they were declared in the connection URL, so the first available host is used for all queries.For example, let's say that the connection URL is the following: `jdbc:mariadb:sequential:host1,host2,host3/testdb`When the connector tries to connect, it will always try host1 first. If that host is not available, then it will try host2. etc. When a host fails, the connector will try to reconnect to hosts in the same order.
* Introduced: 1.3.0

**`loadbalance`**

* Description: This mode supports connection load-balancing in a multi-master environment, such as MariaDB Galera Cluster. This mode does not support load-balancing reads on replicas. The connector performs load-balancing for all queries by randomly picking a host from the connection URL for each connection, so queries will be load-balanced as a result of the connections getting randomly distributed across all hosts. Before 2.4.2, this option was named `failover` - alias still exist for compatibility -
* Introduced: 1.2.0

**`replication`**

* Description: This mode supports connection failover in a primary-replica environment, such as a MariaDB Replication cluster. The mode supports environments with one or more masters. This mode does support load-balancing reads on replicas if the connection is set to read-only before executing the read. The connector performs load-balancing by randomly picking a replica from the connection URL to execute read queries for a connection
* Introduced: 1.2.0

**`load-balance-read`**

* Description: When running a multi-master cluster (i.e. Galera), writing to more than one node can lead to optimistic locking errors ("deadlocks"). Writing concurrently to multiple nodes also doesn't bring a whole lot of performance, due to having to (synchronously) replicate to all nodes anyway. This mode supports connection failover in a multi-master environment, such as MariaDB Galera Cluster. This mode does support load-balancing reads on replicas. The connector will try to connect to primary hosts in the order in which they were declared in the connection URL, so the first available host is used for all queries.For example, let's say that the connection URL is the following: `jdbc:mariadb:load-balance-read:primary1,primary2,address=(host=replica1)(type=replica),address=(host=replica2)(type=replica)/DB`When the connector tries to connect, it will always try primary1 first. If that host is not available, then it will try primary2. etc. When a primary host fails, the connector will try to reconnect to hosts in the same order.For replica hosts, the connector performs load-balancing for all queries by randomly picking a replica host from the connection URL for each connection, so queries will be load-balanced as a result of the connections getting randomly distributed across all replica hosts.
* Introduced: 3.5.1

**`aurora`**

* Description: This mode supports connection failover in an Amazon Aurora cluster. This mode does support load-balancing reads on replica instances if the connection is set to read-only before executing the read. The connector performs load-balancing by randomly picking a replica instance to execute read queries for a connection
* Introduced: 1.2.0 and not supported anymore since 3.0 version

{% hint style="danger" %}
driver 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the connector. Specific support for aurora has not been implemented in 3.0, since it relies on pipelining. Aurora is not compatible with pipelining.\
Issues for Aurora were piling up without the community proposing any PR for them and without access for us to test those modifications. (2.x version has a 5 years support).
{% endhint %}

### Optional URL Parameters

General remark: Unknown options are accepted and silently ignored.

The following options are currently supported.

#### Essential Parameters

**`user`**

* Description: User name.
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `null`
* Introduced: 1.0.0

**`password`**

* Description: password
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `null`
* Introduced: 1.0.0

**`connectTimeout`**

* Description: The connect timeout value, in milliseconds, or zero for no timeout
* Data Type: `integer`
* Default Value: `30 000`
* Introduced: 1.1.8

**`useServerPrepStmts`**

* Description: Text (default) is a globaly a safe default behavior, always working without issue. Binary protocol (useServerPrepStmts=true) has usually good benefits, but that depends: if missing cache, it will have an overhead of preparing before execution. If hitting cache, this perform better, but difference usually isn't huge, because most of the queries have simple execution plan. This is totally depending on queries, but to have some order of difference, here is some realistic differences : missing cache : 50% performance loss / hitting cache: 5-10% performance gain (because simple execution plan).\
  Another thing to consider : Since [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106) Server with [MDEV-19237](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19237), server now permits to avoid resending metadata when they haven’t changed when enabling useServerPrepStmts option (This concerns SQL commands that return a result-set). This avoids useless information transiting on the network and parsing those metadata, and that permit huge gain (around 10-30% depending on query, metadata can be huge compare to resultset data). So, if you use a MariaDB server version 10.6, and application doesn't execute completly differents queries, binary protocol (option 'useServerPrepStmts') is recommended.
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `false`
* Introduced: 1.3.0

**`allowLocalInfile`**

* Description: Permit loading data from file. see [LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE](about-mariadb-connector-j.md#load-data-infile). Having this option enable can impact batch performance. Disabling it can permit some batch improvement

### JDBC API Implementation Notes

#### Size consideration

GSSAPI in windows isn't well supported in java, causing recurrent issues. Since 3.1, waffle-jna is marked as a dependency to provide good GSSAPI support without problems. This has the drawback to make connector and dependencies to a size of around 4Mb.

If size is important, the dependency can be removed, the connector working great, just will have some limitation using GSSAPI on windows :

this can be done like this:

* using maven

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
	<artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
	<version>3.1.0</version>
        <exclusions>
          <exclusion>
            <groupId>com.github.waffle</groupId>
            <artifactId>waffle-jna</artifactId>
          </exclusion>
      </exclusions> 
</dependency>
```

* using graddle:

```
dependencies {
    implementation('org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client:3.1.0') {
        exclude group: 'com.github.waffle', module: 'waffle-jna'
    }
}
```

#### Parsec authentication

Since 3.5.1, parsec authentication is implemented in connector.\
This requires java 15+ (to use java native ed25519 Algorithm implementation).

In order to use parsec authentication with previous version of java, BouncyCastle is required as dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
            <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
            <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk18on</artifactId>
            <version>1.78.1</version>
        </dependency>
```

#### Timezone consideration

**The Ideal Scenario**

The simplest approach to avoid time zone headaches is for the client and server to operate in the same time zone.

**Java Connector Timezone Options**

There are 3 options that control timestamps behavior in the java connector:

* connectionTimeZone: (LOCAL | SERVER | ) - This option defines the connection's time zone. LOCAL retrieves the JVM's default time zone, SERVER fetches the server's global time zone upon connection creation, and allows specifying a server time zone without requesting it during connection establishment.
* forceConnectionTimeZoneToSession: (true | false) - This setting dictates whether the connector enforces the connection time zone for the session.
* preserveInstants: (true | false) - This option controls whether the connector converts Timestamp values to the connection's time zone.

**Recommendation**

By default, the connector adopts the JVM's default time zone. If the client and server reside in different time zones, it's recommended to configure the connection time zone to match the JVM's default by setting forceConnectionTimeZoneToSession to true.\
This ensures proper operation of time functions.

(This isn’t the default behavior because there is a server Requirements to set tzinfo depending on the JVM's time zones)

**TIMESTAMP vs. DATETIME: Know the Difference**

Just like Java's Instant and LocalDateTime, server-side TIMESTAMP and DATETIME fields serve distinct purposes. One represents a specific point in time (a moment), while the other doesn't.

* TIMESTAMP: This represents an exact moment on the timeline, expressed using the connection's time zone. When stored, it gets converted to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) for consistency. Upon retrieval, it's converted back to the connection's time zone for display.
* DATETIME: This combines date and time-of-day information but doesn't represent a specific moment.

**The Misuse of DATETIME:**

Due to its wider range, DATETIME is sometimes mistakenly used to store a specific point in time. While this might work if the client and server share the same time zone, it creates problems when they differ.

**A (Discouraged) Workaround:**

While using DATETIME instead of TIMESTAMP is generally discouraged, a specific combination of settings ("preserveInstants=true\&connectionTimeZone=SERVER") can force all Java Timestamp exchanges to be converted to the connection's time zone during storage and retrieval. However, this approach is not recommended for long-term solutions.

**Compatibility with Older Connectors (Pre-3.4):**

The MariaDB Connector/J versions before 3.4 offered a single "timezone" option. While this functionality remains compatible, it's now separated into two distinct settings: connectionTimeZone and forceConnectionTimeZoneToSession. Here's a breakdown of how the old option translates to the new ones:\
"timezone=America/Los\_Angeles" is equivalent to "connectionTimeZone=America/Los\_Angeles\&forceConnectionTimeZone=true

To mimic the behavior of the "useLegacyDatetimeCode=false" option from MariaDB 2.x, you can set the following combination: “connectionTimeZone=SERVER\&preserveInstants=true”

Note: Unlike the MySQL Connector, the MariaDB Connector/J defaults connectionTimeZone to LOCAL (JVM's default) instead of SERVER.

#### "LOAD DATA INFILE"

{% hint style="info" %}
LOAD DATA INFILE was the fastest way to load data. Now the fastest way is the standard JDBC executeBatch() when option 'useBulkStmts' is enabled
{% endhint %}

The fastest way to load lots of data is using [LOAD DATA INFILE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/load-data-into-tables-or-index/load-data-infile). However, using "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE" (ie: loading a file from the client) may be a security problem if someone can execute a query from the client, he can have access to any file on the client (according to the rights of the user running the client process).

A specific option "allowLocalInfile" (default to true) can disable this functionality on the client side.\
The global variable [local\_infile](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#local_infile) can disable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE on the server side.

You can provide custom stream as well using a specific setLocalInfileInputStream

```
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
        org.mariadb.jdbc.Statement mariaDbStatement =
            statement.unwrap(org.mariadb.jdbc.Statement.class);
        mariaDbStatement.setLocalInfileInputStream(in);

        String sql =
            "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'notUsed'"
                + " INTO TABLE myTable "
                + " FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\\t' ENCLOSED BY ''"
                + " ESCAPED BY '\\\\' LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'";
        statement.execute(sql);
```

Contrary to mysql connector, setLocalInfileInputStream value can only be used for next execution.

#### Set a Query Timeout

Driver follow the JDBC specifications, permitting Statement.setQueryTimeout() for a particular statement.

If the goal is to set a timeout for all queries, the server permits a [limiting query time](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/query-optimizations/aborting-statements) by setting the system variable [max\_statement\_time](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#max_statement_time).

This solution will handle query timeout better (and faster) than java solutions (JPA2, "javax.persistence.query.timeout", Pools integrated solution like tomcat jdbc-pool "queryTimeout"...).

Option "sessionVariables" permit to set this system variable easily :\
Example :

```java
#will set a maximum query timeout of 10 seconds for this connection
jdbc:mariadb://localhost/db?user=user&sessionVariables=max_statement_time=10
```

#### Streaming Result Sets

By default, `Statement.executeQuery()` will read the full result set from the server.\
With large result sets, this will require large amounts of memory.

To avoid using too much memory, rather use Statement.setFetchSize(int numberOfRowInMemory) to indicate the number of rows that will be stored in memory\
Example :\
using `Statement.setFetchSize(1000)` indicates that 1000 rows will be stored in memory.\
So, when the query has executed, 1000 rows will be in memory. After 1000 `ResultSet.next()`, the next 1000 rows will be stored in memory, and so on.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If another query is run on same connection while the resultset has not been completly read, the connector will fetch all remaining rows before executing the query. This can lead to still needing lots of memory. Recommendation is then to use another connection for simultaneous operations.
{% endhint %}

Note that the server usually expects clients to read off the result set relatively quickly. The [net\_write\_timeout](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#net_write_timeout) server variable controls this behavior (defaults to 60s).\
If you don't expect results to be handled in this amount of time there is a different possibility:

* With you can use the query "SET STATEMENT net\_write\_timeout=10000 FOR XXX" with XXX your "normal" query. This will indicate that specifically for this query, [net\_write\_timeout](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#net_write_timeout) will be set to a longer time (10000 in this example).
* for older servers, a specific query will have to temporarily set net\_write\_timeout ("SET STATEMENT net\_write\_timeout=..."), and set it back afterward.
* if your application usually uses a lot of long queries with fetch size, the connection can be set using option "sessionVariables=net\_write\_timeout=xxx"

Even using setFetchSize, the server will send all results to the client.

If another query is executed on the same connection when a streaming resultset has not been fully read, the connector will put the whole remaining streaming resultset in memory in order to execute the next query. This can lead to OutOfMemoryError if not handled.

Before version 1.4.0, the only accepted value for fetch size was `Statement.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE)` (equivalent to `Statement.setFetchSize(1)`). This value is still accepted for compatilibity reasons but rather use `Statement.setFetchSize(1)`, since according to JDBC the value must be >= 0.

#### Prepared Statements

The driver uses server prepared statements as a standard to communicate with the database (since 1.3.0). If the "allowMultiQueries" options are set to true, the driver will only use text protocol. Prepared statements (parameter substitution) is handled by the driver, on the client side.

#### CallableStatement

Callable statement implementation won't need to access stored procedure\
metadata ([mysql.proc](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-proc-table)) table if both of following are true

* CallableStatement.getMetadata() is not used
* Parameters are accessed by index, not by name

When possible, following the two rules above provides both better speed and\
eliminates concerns about SELECT privileges on the[mysql.proc](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-proc-table) table.

Java permit retrieving last generated keys,using [Statement.getGeneratedKeys()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.sql/java/sql/Statement.html#getGeneratedKeys\(\)).

Example:

```
Statement stmt = sharedConn.createStatement();
    stmt.execute(
            "INSERT INTO executeGenerated(t2) values (100)", Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);
    ResultSet rs = stmt.getGeneratedKeys();
    rs.next();
    System.out.println(rs.getInt(1));
```

Only the the first generated key will be returned, meaning that for multi-insert the generated key retrieved will correspond to the first generated value of the command.

If retrieving all generated values for multiple insert is needed, please use [INSERT...RETURNING](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/insertreturning) command (since [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105)).

#### Optional JDBC Classes

The following optional interfaces are implemented by the\
org.mariadb.jdbc.MariaDbDataSource class : javax.sql.DataSource,\
javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource, javax.sql.XADataSource

careful : org.mariadb.jdbc.MySQLDataSource doesn't exist anymore and should be replaced with org.mariadb.jdbc.MariaDbDataSource since v1.3.0

### Usage Examples

The following code provides a basic example of how to connect to a MariaDB or\
MySQL server and create a table.

**Creating a Table on a MariaDB or MySQL Server**

```java
Connection  connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/test", "username", "password");
Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
stmt.executeUpdate("CREATE TABLE a (id int not null primary key, value varchar(20))");
stmt.close();
connection.close();
```

### Services

The driver implements 3 kinds of services:

* Credential service: permit giving credential
* Authentication service: permit adding client authentication plugins.
* SSL factory service: custom TSL implementation

#### Credential service

Credentials are usually set using user/password in the connection string or by using DriverManager.getConnection(String url, String user, String password).

Credential plugins permit to provide credential information from other means. Those plugins have to be activated setting option `credentialType` to designated plugin.

The driver has 3 default plugins :

**AWS IAM**

This permits AWS database IAM authentication. The plugin generate a token using IAM credential and region. Token is valid for 15 minutes and cached for 10 minutes.

To use this credential authentication, com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-rds dependency must be registred in classpath.\
Implementation use SDK DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain and DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain to get IAM credential and region.\
see [DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) and [DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html) to check how those information can be retrieved (environment variable / system properties, files, ...)

Example: `jdbc:mariadb://host/db?credentialType=AWS-IAM&useSsl&serverSslCert=/somepath/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem`

with AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID, AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY and AWS\_REGION environment variable set.

**Environment**

User and Password are retrieved from environment variables. default environment variables are MARIADB\_USER and MARIADB\_PWD, but can be changed by setting additional option `userKey` and `pwdKey`

Example : using connection string `jdbc:mariadb://host/db?credentialType=ENV` user and password will be retrieved from environment variable MARIADB\_USER and MARIADB\_PWD.

**Property**

User and Password are retrieved from java properties. default property name are mariadb.user and mariadb.pwd, but property names can be changed by setting additional option `userKey` and `pwdKey`

Example : using connection string `jdbc:mariadb://host/db?credentialType=PROPERTY&userKey=mariadbUser&pwdKey=mariadbPwd` user and password will be retrieved from java properties `mariadbUser` and `mariadbPwd`

#### Authentication service

[Client authentication plugins](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/plugins/authentication-plugins) are now defined as services. This permits to easily add new client authentication plugins.

List of authentication plugins in java connector :

* mysql\_clear\_password
* auth\_gssapi\_client
* client\_ed25519
* mysql\_native\_password
* mysql\_old\_password
* dialog (PAM)
* sha256\_password
* caching\_sha2\_password

New authentication plugins can be created implementing interface org.mariadb.jdbc.authentication.AuthenticationPlugin, and listing new plugin in a META-INF/services/org.mariadb.jdbc.authentication.AuthenticationPlugin file.

#### SSL factory service

Custom SSL implementation can be used implementing\
A connection to a server initially creates a socket. When set, SSL socket is layered over this existing socket.\
Implementing org.mariadb.jdbc.tls.TlsSocketPlugin permit to provide custom SSL implementation for example create a new [HostnameVerifier](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/HostnameVerifier.html) implementation.

Custom implementation need to implement org.mariadb.jdbc.tls.TlsSocketPlugin and register service META-INF/services/org.mariadb.jdbc.tls.TlsSocketPlugin

Custom implementation are activated using option `tlsSocketType`

**Easy to use logging**

In MariaDB Connector/J 3.0, logging can now be enabled at runtime. Connector/J uses the slf4j API if it is installed. Otherwise, Connector/J uses the JDK logger / console.

logger name is "org.mariadb.jdbc".

Connector/J supports the following Java logging levels:

| Log Levels   | Description            |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Log Levels   | Description            |
| INFO         | Logs connection errors |
| DEBUG/FINE   | Logs SQL statements    |
| TRACE/FINEST | Logs network exchanges |

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be careful with "trace" level, purpose is to log all exchanges with server.\
This means huge amount of data.\
Bad configuration can lead to problems, like quickly filling the disk.
{% endhint %}

Example of configuring "trace" level on driver for logback: file logback.xml in src/main/resources/

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<configuration>

    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder">
            <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <logger name="org.mariadb.jdbc" level="trace" additivity="false">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </logger>

    <root level="error">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
    </root>

</configuration>
```

Exemple of generated logs :

```

### F.A.Q.

**Error "Could not read resultset: unexpected end of stream, read 0 bytes from 4"**

There is an issue communicating with the server.

Most of the time this will be caused by reading a query that has a large resultset; the server usually expects clients to read off the result set relatively quickly. The [net\_write\_timeout](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#net_write_timeout) server variable controls this behavior (defaults to 60s). If the client doesn't read the whole resultset in that amount of time, the server will discard the connection.\
If you don't expect results to be handled in this amount of time there is another possibility:

* You can use the query "SET STATEMENT net\_write\_timeout=10000 FOR XXX" with XXX being your "normal" query. This will indicate that specifically for this query, [net\_write\_timeout](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#net_write_timeout) will be set to a longer time (10000 in this example).
* for older servers, a specific query will have to temporarily set net\_write\_timeout ("SET STATEMENT net\_write\_timeout=..."), and set it back afterward.
* if your application usually uses a lot of long queries with fetch size, the connection can be set using the "sessionVariables=net\_write\_timeout=xxx" option.

**How to Do a Lightweight Ping / Avoid Mass "select 1"**

Connection.isValid() is a good approach.\
Connection.isValid() is doing a ping (ping in mysql protocol, not network ping).\
Connection pool using JDBC4 Validation are using automatically this Connection.isValid()
