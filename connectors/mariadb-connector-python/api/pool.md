# The ConnectionPool class

### *class* ConnectionPool(\*args, \*\*kwargs)

Class defining a pool of database connections

MariaDB Connector/Python supports simple connection pooling.
A connection pool holds a number of open connections and handles
thread safety when providing connections to threads.

The size of a connection pool is configurable at creation time,
but cannot be changed afterwards. The maximum size of a connection
pool is limited to 64 connections.

Keyword Arguments:

> * pool_name (str) – Name of connection pool
> * pool_size (int)=5 – Size of pool. If not specified default value
>   of 5 will be used. Maximum allowed number is 64.
> * pool_reset_connection (bool)=True – Will reset the connection before
>   returning it to the pool.  Default value is True.
> * pool_validation_interval (int)=500 – Specifies the validation
>   interval in milliseconds after which the status of a connection
>   requested from the pool is checked.
>   The default value is 500 milliseconds, a value of 0 means that
>   the status will always be checked.
>   (Added in version 1.1.6)

> >   kwargs: Optional additional connection arguments, as described in

## ConnectionPool methods

#### ConnectionPool.add_connection(connection=None)

Adds a connection object to the connection pool.

In case that the pool doesn’t have a free slot or is not configured
a PoolError exception will be raised.

#### ConnectionPool.close()

Closes connection pool and all connections.

#### ConnectionPool.get_connection()

Returns a connection from the connection pool or raises a PoolError
exception if a connection is not available.

#### ConnectionPool.set_config(\*\*kwargs)

Sets the connection configuration for the connection pool.
For valid connection arguments check the mariadb.connect() method.

Note: This method doesn’t create connections in the pool.
To fill the pool one has to use add_connection() ḿethod.
