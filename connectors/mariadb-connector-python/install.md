# Installation

## Prerequisites

The current MariaDB Connector/Python implementation supports

* Python versions from 3.7 to 3.11
* MariaDB server versions from version 10.3 or MySQL server versions from version 5.7.
* MariaDB client library (MariaDB Connector/C) from version 3.3.1.

## Binary installation

### Microsoft Windows

To install MariaDB Connector/Python on Microsoft Windows, you first have to install a recent version of MariaDB Connector/C. MSI installer for
both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems are available from [MariaDB Connector Download page](https://mariadb.com/downloads/connectors/).

After installation of MariaDB Connector/C download and install MariaDB Connector/Python with the following command:

```console
pip3 install mariadb
```

On success, you should see a message at the end “Successfully installed mariadb-x.y.z”, where x.y.z is
the recent version of MariaDB Connector/Python.

```console

## Installation from Source

### Build prerequisites

The following build prerequisites are required to install or build MariaDB Connector/Python from source code, github or from
pypi.org.

To install MariaDB Connector/Python from sources you will need:

- C compiler
- Python development files (Usually they are installed with package **python3-dev**). The minimum supported version of Python is 3.7.
- MariaDB Connector/C libraries and header files (Either from MariaDB server package or
  from  MariaDB Connector/C package). Minimum required version for MariaDB Connector/Python < 1.1.0 is 3.1.5, for later versions 3.3.1.
  If your distribution doesn’t provide a recent version of MariaDB Connector/C you can either download binary packages from [MariaDB Connector Download page](https://mariadb.com/downloads/connectors/) or build
  the package from source.
- The mariadb_config program from MariaDB Connector/C, which should be in your PATH directory.
- For Posix systems: TLS libraries, e.g. GnuTLS or OpenSSL (default)
- Since MariaDB Connector/Python 1.1.5: Python’s “packaging” module.

On Posix systems make sure that the path environment variable contains the directory which
contains the mariadb_config utility.

Once everything is in place, run

```console
pip3 install mariadb
```

or if you downloaded the source package

```console
cd source_package_dir
python3 -m pip install .
```

For troubleshooting please also check the chapter [Installation](faq.md#installation-faq) from the FAQ page.

## Test suite

If you have installed the sources, after successful build you can run the test suite
from the source directory.

```console
cd testing
python3 -m unittest discover -v
```

You can configure the connection parameters by using the following environment variables

* TEST_DB_USER (default root)
* TEST_DB_PASSWORD
* TEST_DB_DATABASE (default ‘testp’)
* TEST_DB_HOST (default ‘localhost’)
* TEST_DB_PORT (default 3306)
