# Basic usage

## Connecting

The basic usage of MariaDB Connector/Python is similar to other database drivers which
implement DB API 2.0 ([PEP-249](https://peps.python.org/pep-249)).

Below is a simple example of a typical use of MariaDB Connector/Python

<!-- import mariadb

# connection parameters
conn_params= {
   "user" : "example_user",
   "password" : "GHbe_Su3B8",
   "host" : "localhost",
   "database" : "test"
}

# Establish a connection
with mariadb.connect(**conn_params) as conn:
   with conn.cursor() as cursor:
      cursor.execute("CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `countries` ("
                "`id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,"
                "`name` varchar(50) NOT NULL,"
                "`country_code` char(3) NOT NULL,"
                "`capital` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,"
                "PRIMARY KEY (`id`),"
                "KEY `name` (`name`),"
                "KEY `capital` (`capital`)"
                ") ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1") -->
```python
import mariadb

# connection parameters
conn_params= {
    "user" : "example_user",
    "password" : "GHbe_Su3B8",
    "host" : "localhost",
    "database" : "test"
}

# Establish a connection
with mariadb.connect(**conn_params) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Populate countries table  with some data
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO countries(name, country_code, capital) VALUES (?,?,?)",
            ("Germany", "GER", "Berlin"))

        # retrieve data
        cursor.execute("SELECT name, country_code, capital FROM countries")

        # print content
        row= cursor.fetchone()
        print(*row, sep=' ')
```

*Output*:

```none
Germany GER Berlin
```

Before MariaDB Connector/Python can be used, the MariaDB Connector/Python module must be
imported.
Once the mariadb module is loaded, a connection to a database server will be established
using the method [`connect()`](module.md#mariadb.connect).

In order to be able to communicate with the database server in the form of SQL statements,
a cursor object must be created first.

The method name cursor may be a little misleading: unlike a cursor in MariaDB that can only
read and return data, a cursor in Python can be used for all types of SQL statements.

After creating the table mytest, everything is ready to insert some data: Column values
that are to be inserted in the database are identified by place holders, the data is then passed in
the form of a tuple as a second parameter.

After creating and populating the table mytest the cursor will be used to retrieve the data.

At the end we free resources and close cursor and connection.

## Passing parameters to SQL statements

As shown in previous example, passing parameters to SQL statements happens by using placeholders in the statement. By default
MariaDB Connector/Python uses a question mark as a placeholder, for compatibility reason also %s placeholders are supported.
Passing parameters is supported in methods `execute()` and `executemany()` of the cursor class.

Since MariaDB Connector/Python uses binary protocol, escaping strings or binary data like in other database drivers is not required.

```python
import mariadb

# connection parameters
conn_params= {
    "user" : "example_user",
    "password" : "GHbe_Su3B8",
    "host" : "localhost",
    "database" : "test"
}

# Establish a connection
with mariadb.connect(**conn_params) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        sql= "INSERT INTO countries (name, country_code, capital) VALUES (?,?,?)"
        data= ("Germany", "GER", "Berlin")
        cursor.execute(sql, data)

        conn.commit()

        # delete last entry
        sql= "DELETE FROM countries WHERE country_code=?"
        data= ("GER",)
        cursor.execute(sql, data)

        conn.commit()
```

Often there is a requirement to update, delete or insert multiple records. This could be done be using `execute()` in
a loop, but much more effective is using the `executemany()` method, especially when using a MariaDB database server 10.2 and above, which supports a special “bulk” protocol. The executemany() works similar to execute(), but accepts data as a list of tuples:

```python
import mariadb

# connection parameters
conn_params= {
    "user" : "example_user",
    "password" : "GHbe_Su3B8",
    "host" : "localhost",
    "database" : "test"
}

# Establish a connection
with mariadb.connect(**conn_params) as connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        sql= "INSERT INTO countries (name, country_code, capital) VALUES (?,?,?)"

        data= [("Ireland", "IE", "Dublin"),
               ("Italy", "IT", "Rome"),
               ("Malaysia", "MY", "Kuala Lumpur"),
               ("France", "FR", "Paris"),
               ("Iceland", "IS", "Reykjavik"),
               ("Nepal", "NP", "Kathmandu")]

        # insert data
        cursor.executemany(sql, data)

        # Since autocommit is off by default, we need to commit last transaction
        connection.commit()

        # Instead of 3 letter country-code, we inserted 2 letter country code, so
        # let's fix this mistake by updating data
        sql= "UPDATE countries SET country_code=? WHERE name=?"
        data= [("Ireland", "IRL"),
               ("Italy", "ITA"),
               ("Malaysia", "MYS"),
               ("France", "FRA"),
               ("Iceland", "ISL"),
               ("Nepal", "NPL")]
        cursor.executemany(sql, data)

        # Now let's delete all non European countries
        sql= "DELETE FROM countries WHERE name=?"
        data= [("Malaysia",), ("Nepal",)]
        cursor.executemany(sql, data)

        # by default autocommit is off, so we need to commit
        # our transactions
        connection.commit()
```

When using executemany(), there are a few restrictions:
- All tuples must have the same types as in first tuple. E.g. the parameter [(1),(1.0)] or [(1),(None)] are invalid.
- Special values like None or column default value needs to be indicated by an indicator.

### Using indicators

In certain situations, for example when inserting default values or NULL, special indicators must be used.

```python
import mariadb
from mariadb.constants import *

import mariadb

# connection parameters
conn_params= {
    "user" : "example_user",
    "password" : "GHbe_Su3B8",
    "host" : "localhost",
    "database" : "test"
}

# Establish a connection
with mariadb.connect(**conn_params) as connection:
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cakes")
        cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE cakes(id int, cake varchar(100), price decimal(10,2) default 1.99)")

        sql= "INSERT INTO cakes (id, cake, price) VALUES (?,?,?)"
        data= [(1, "Cherry Cake", 2.10), (2, "Apple Cake", INDICATOR.DEFAULT)]
        cursor.executemany(sql, data)
```

Beside the default indicator which inserts the default value of 1.99, the following indicators are supported:
: * INDICATOR.IGNORE: Ignores the value (only update commands)
  * INDICATOR.NULL: Value is NULL
  * INDICATOR.IGNORE_ROW: Don’t update or insert row

#### NOTE
* Mixing different parameter styles is not supported and will raise an exception
* The Python string operator % must not be used. The `execute()` method accepts a tuple or list as second parameter.
* Placeholders between quotation marks are interpreted as a string.
* Parameters for `execute()` needs to be passed as a tuple. If only one parameter will be passed, tuple needs to contain a comma at the end.
* Parameters for `executemany()` need to be passed as a list of tuples.

#### Supported Data types

Several standard python types are converted into SQL types and returned as Python objects when a statement is executed.
