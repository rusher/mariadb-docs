# Server System Variables

### About the Server System Variables

MariaDB has many system variables that can be changed to suit your needs.

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/for-a-full-list-of-server-v....md" %}

Most of the system variables are described on this page, but some are described elsewhere:

* [Aria System Variables](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables.md)
* [CONNECT System Variables](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/connect/connect-system-variables.md)
* [Galera System Variables](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables)
* [Global Transaction ID System Variables](../../standard-replication/gtid.md#system-variables-for-global-transaction-id)
* [HandlerSocket Plugin System Variables](../../../reference/sql-structure/nosql/handlersocket/handlersocket-configuration-options.md)
* [InnoDB System Variables](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md)

* [MyISAM System Variables](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md)
* [Performance Schema System Variables](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-system-variables.md)
* [Replication and Binary Log System Variables](../../standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md)
* [S3 Storage Engine System Variables](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/s3-storage-engine/s3-storage-engine-system-variables.md)
* [Server\_Audit System Variables](../../../reference/plugins/mariadb-audit-plugin/mariadb-audit-plugin-options-and-system-variables.md)

* [Threadpool System Variables](../buffers-caches-and-threads/thread-pool/thread-pool-system-status-variables.md)
* [TokuDB System Variables](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/tokudb/tokudb-system-variables.md)
* [Vector System Variables](../../../reference/sql-structure/vectors/vector-system-variables.md)

See also the [Full list of MariaDB options, system and status variables](../../../reference/full-list-of-mariadb-options-system-and-status-variables.md).

Most of these can be set with [command line options](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md) and many of them can be changed at runtime.\
Variables that can be changed at runtime (and therefore are not read-only) are described as "Dynamic" below, and elsewhere in the documentation.

There are a few ways to see the full list of server system variables:

* While in the mariadb client, run:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES;
```

* See [SHOW VARIABLES](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-variables.md) for instructions on using this command.
* From your shell, run mariadbd like so:

```
mariadbd --verbose --help
```

* View the Information Schema [GLOBAL\_VARIABLES](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-global_variables-and-session_variables-tables.md), [SESSION\_VARIABLES](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-global_variables-and-session_variables-tables.md), and [SYSTEM\_VARIABLES](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-system_variables-table.md) tables.

### Setting Server System Variables

There are several ways to set server system variables:

* Specify them on the command line:

```
shell> ./mariadbd-safe --aria_group_commit="hard"
```

* Specify them in your my.cnf file (see [Configuring MariaDB with my.cnf](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md) for more information):

```
aria_group_commit = "hard"
```

* Set them from the mariadb client using the [SET](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set.md) command. Only variables that are dynamic can be set at runtime in this way. Note that variables set in this way will not persist after a restart.

```sql
SET GLOBAL aria_group_commit="hard";
```

By convention, server variables have usually been specified with an underscore in the configuration files, and a dash on the command line. You can however specify underscores as dashes - they are interchangeable.

Variables that take a numeric size can either be specified in full, or with a suffix for easier readability. Valid suffixes are:

| Suffix | Description | Value                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### List of Server System Variables

#### `allow_suspicious_udfs`

* Description: Allows use of [user-defined functions](../../../server-usage/user-defined-functions/) consisting of only one symbol `x()` without corresponding `x_init()` or `x_deinit()`. That also means that one can load any function from any library, for example `exit()` from `libc.so`. Not recommended unless you require old UDFs with one symbol that cannot be recompiled. Before [MariaDB 10.10](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-10-series/what-is-mariadb-1010), available as an [option only](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-allow-suspicious-udfs).
* Commandline: `--allow-suspicious-udfs`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`
* Introduced: [MariaDB 10.10](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-10-series/what-is-mariadb-1010)

#### `alter_algorithm`

* Description: The implied `ALGORITHM` for [ALTER TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md) if no `ALGORITHM` clause is specified. The deprecated variable [old\_alter\_table](server-system-variables.md#old_alter_table) is an alias for this. The feature was removed in [MariaDB 11.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115). See [ALGORITHM=DEFAULT](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table.md#algorithmdefault).
  * `COPY` corresponds to the pre-MySQL 5.1 approach of creating an intermediate table, copying data one row at a time, and renaming and dropping tables.
  * `INPLACE` requests that the operation be refused if it cannot be done natively inside a the storage engine.
  * `DEFAULT` (the default) chooses `INPLACE` if available, and falls back to `COPY`.
  * `NOCOPY` refuses to copy a table.
  * `INSTANT` refuses an operation that would involve any other than metadata changes.
* Commandline: `--alter-algorithm=default`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `enumerated`
* Default Value: `DEFAULT`
* Valid Values: `DEFAULT`, `COPY`, `INPLACE`, `NOCOPY`, `INSTANT`
* Introduced: [MariaDB 10.3.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-1037-release-notes)
* Deprecated: [MariaDB 11.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115)

#### `analyze_sample_percentage`

* Description: Percentage of rows from the table [ANALYZE TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/table-statements/analyze-table.md) will sample to collect table statistics. Set to 0 to let MariaDB decide what percentage of rows to sample.
* Commandline: `--analyze-sample-percentage=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `100.000000`
* Range: `0` to `100`
* Introduced: [MariaDB 10.4.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/mariadb-1043-release-notes)

#### `autocommit`

* Description: If set to 1, the default, all queries are committed immediately. The [LOCK IN SHARE MODE](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/lock-in-share-mode.md) and [FOR UPDATE](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/for-update.md) clauses therefore have no effect. If set to 0, they are only committed upon a [COMMIT](../../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/commit.md) statement, or rolled back with a [ROLLBACK](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/) statement. If autocommit is set to 0, and then changed to 1, all open transactions are immediately committed.
* Commandline: `--autocommit[=#]`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `1`

#### `automatic_sp_privileges`

* Description: When set to 1, the default, when a stored routine is created, the creator is automatically granted permission to [ALTER](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/alter-procedure.md) (which includes dropping) and to EXECUTE the routine. If set to 0, the creator is not automatically granted these privileges.
* Commandline: `--automatic-sp-privileges`, `--skip-automatic-sp-privileges`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `1`

#### `back_log`

* Description: Connections take a small amount of time to start, and this setting determines the number of outstanding connection requests MariaDB can have, or the size of the listen queue for incoming TCP/IP requests. Requests beyond this will be refused. Increase if you expect short bursts of connections. Cannot be set higher than the operating system limit (see the Unix listen() man page). If not set, set to `0`, or the `--autoset-back-log` option is used, will be autoset to the lower of `900` and (50 + [max\_connections](server-system-variables.md#max_connections)/5).
* Commandline: `--back-log=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Type: number
* Default Value:
  * The lower of `900` and (50 + [max\_connections](server-system-variables.md#max_connections)/5)

#### `basedir`

* Description: Path to the MariaDB installation directory. Other paths are usually resolved relative to this base directory.
* Commandline: `--basedir=path` or `-b path`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Type: directory name

#### `big_tables`

* Description: If this system variable is set to 1, then temporary tables will be saved to disk intead of memory.
  * This system variable's original intention was to allow result sets that were too big for memory-based temporary tables and to avoid the resulting 'table full' errors.
  * This system variable is no longer needed, because the server can automatically convert large memory-based temporary tables into disk-based temporary tables when they exceed the value of the `[tmp_memory_table_size](#tmp_memory_table_size)` system variable.
  * To prevent memory-based temporary tables from being used at all, set the `[tmp_memory_table_size](#tmp_memory_table_size)` system variable to `0`.
  * In [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/) and earlier, `[sql_big_tables](#sql_big_tables)` is a synonym.
  * In [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), this system variable is deprecated.
* Commandline: `--big-tables`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `0`
* Deprecated: [MariaDB 10.5.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1050-release-notes)

#### `bind_address`

* Description: By default, the MariaDB server listens for TCP/IP connections on all addresses. You can specify an alternative when the server starts using this option; either a host name, an IPv4 or an IPv6 address, "::" or "_" (all addresses). In some systems, such as Debian and Ubuntu, the bind\_address is set to 127.0.0.1, which binds the server to listen on localhost only. `bind_address` has always been available as a_ [_mariadbd option_](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md)_; from_ [_MariaDB 10.3.3_](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-1033-release-notes) _its also available as a system variable. Before_ [_MariaDB 10.6.0_](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/mariadb-1060-release-notes) _"::" implied listening additionally on IPv4 addresses like "_". From 10.6.0 onwards it refers to IPv6 stictly. Starting with [MariaDB 10.11](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-11-series/what-is-mariadb-1011), a comma-separated list of addresses to bind to can be given. See also [Configuring MariaDB for Remote Client Access](../../../../kb/en/configuring-mariadb-for-remote-client-access/).
* Commandline: `--bind-address=addr`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: (Empty string)
* Valid Values: Host name, IPv4, IPv6, ::, \*
* Introduced: [MariaDB 10.3.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-1033-release-notes) (as a system variable)

#### `block_encryption_mode`

* Description: Default block encryption mode for [AES\_ENCRYPT()](../../../reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/aes_encrypt.md) and [AES\_DECRYPT()](../../../reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/encryption-hashing-and-compression-functions/aes_decrypt.md) functions.
* Commandline: `--block-encryption-mode=val`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `aes-128-ecb`
* Valid values: `aes-128-ecb`, `aes-192-ecb`, `aes-256-ecb`, `aes-128-cbc`, `aes-192-cbc`, `aes-256-cbc`, `aes-128-ctr`, `aes-192-ctr`, `aes-256-ctr`
* Introduced: [MariaDB 11.2.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-2-series/mariadb-11-2-0-release-notes)

#### `bulk_insert_buffer_size`

* Description: Size in bytes of the per-thread cache tree used to speed up bulk inserts into [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) and [Aria](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/) tables. A value of 0 disables the cache tree.
* Commandline: `--bulk-insert-buffer-size=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `8388608`
* Range - 32 bit: `0` to `4294967295`
* Range - 64 bit: `0` to `18446744073709547520`

#### `character_set_client`

* Description: Determines the [character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) for queries arriving from the client. It can be set per session by the client, although the server can be configured to ignore client requests with the `--skip-character-set-client-handshake` option. If the client does not request a character set, or requests a character set that the server does not support, the global value will be used. utf16, utf16le, utf32 and ucs2 cannot be used as client character sets. From [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106), the `utf8` [character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) (and related collations) is by default an alias for `utf8mb3` rather than the other way around. It can be set to imply `utf8mb4` by changing the value of the [old\_mode](server-system-variables.md#old_mode) system variable.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `utf8mb3` (>= [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106)), `utf8` (<= [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105))

#### `character_set_collations`

* Description: Overrides for character set default collations. Takes a comma-delimited list of character set and collation settings, for example `SET @@character_set_collations = 'utf8mb4=uca1400_ai_ci, latin2=latin2_hungarian_ci';` The new variable will take effect in all cases where a character set is explicitly or implicitly specified without an explicit COLLATE clause, including but not limited to:
  * Column collation
  * Table collation
  * Database collation
  * CHAR(expr USING csname)
  * CONVERT(expr USING csname)
  * CAST(expr AS CHAR CHARACTER SET csname)
  * '' - character string literal
  * \_utf8mb3'text' - a character string literal with an introducer
  * \_utf8mb3 X'61' - a character string literal with an introducer with hex notation
  * \_utf8mb3 0x61 - a character string literal with an introducer with hex hybrid notation
  * @@collation\_connection after a SET NAMES without COLLATE
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value:
  * `utf8mb3=utf8mb3_uca1400_ai_ci, ucs2=ucs2_uca1400_ai_ci, utf8mb4=utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci, utf16=utf16_uca1400_ai_ci, utf32=utf32_uca1400_ai_ci` (>= [MariaDB 11.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115))
  * Empty (<= [MariaDB 11.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-11-4-series/what-is-mariadb-114))
* Introduced: [MariaDB 11.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-2-series/what-is-mariadb-112)

#### `character_set_connection`

* Description: [Character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) used for number to string conversion, as well as for literals that don't have a character set introducer. From [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106), the `utf8` [character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) (and related collations) is by default an alias for `utf8mb3` rather than the other way around. It can be set to imply `utf8mb4` by changing the value of the [old\_mode](server-system-variables.md#old_mode) system variable.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `utf8mb3` (>= [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106)), `utf8` (<= [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105))

#### `character_set_database`

* Description: [Character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) used by the default database, and set by the server whenever the default database is changed. If there's no default database, character\_set\_database contains the same value as [character\_set\_server](server-system-variables.md#character_set_server). This variable is dynamic, but should not be set manually, only by the server.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `utf8mb4` (>= [MariaDB 11.6.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-6-rolling-releases/mariadb-11-6-0-release-notes)), `latin1` (<= [MariaDB 11.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-5-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-115))

#### `character_set_filesystem`

* Description: The [character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) for the filesystem. Used for converting file names specified as a string literal from [character\_set\_client](server-system-variables.md#character_set_client) to character\_set\_filesystem before opening the file. By default set to `binary`, so no conversion takes place. This could be useful for statements such as [LOAD\_FILE()](../../../reference/sql-functions/string-functions/load_file.md) or [LOAD DATA INFILE](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/load-data-into-tables-or-index/load-data-infile.md) on system where multi-byte file names are use.
* Commandline: `--character-set-filesystem=name`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `binary`

#### `character_set_results`

It can be set to imply `utf8mb4` by changing the value of the [old\_mode](server-system-variables.md#old_mode) system variable.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `utf8mb3` (>= [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106)), `utf8` (<= [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105))

#### `character_set_server`

* Description: Default [character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) used by the server. See [character\_set\_database](server-system-variables.md#character_set_database) for character sets used by the default database. Defaults may be different on some systems, see for example [Differences in MariaDB in Debian](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/troubleshooting-installation-issues/installation-issues-on-debian-and-ubuntu/differences-in-mariadb-in-debian-and-ubuntu.md).

It can be set to imply `utf8mb4` by changing the value of the [old\_mode](server-system-variables.md#old_mode) system variable.
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `utf8mb3` (>= [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106)), `utf8` (<= [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105))

* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: boolean
* Default: ON

#### `collation_connection`

* Description: Collation used for the connection [character set](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/).
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`

#### `collation_database`

* Description: [Collation used](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) for the default database. Set by the server if the default database changes, if there is no default database the value from the `collation_server` variable is used. This variable is dynamic, but should not be set manually, only by the server.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`

#### `collation_server`

* Description: Default [collation](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/) used by the server. This is set to the default collation for a given character set automatically when [character\_set\_server](server-system-variables.md#character_set_server) is changed, but it can also be set manually. Defaults may be different on some systems, see for example [Differences in MariaDB in Debian](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/troubleshooting-installation-issues/installation-issues-on-debian-and-ubuntu/differences-in-mariadb-in-debian-and-ubuntu.md).

* Default Value: `latin1_swedish_ci`

#### `completion_type`

* Description: The transaction completion type. If set to `NO_CHAIN` or `0` (the default), there is no effect on commits and rollbacks. If set to `CHAIN` or `1`, a [COMMIT](../../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/commit.md) statement is equivalent to COMMIT AND CHAIN, while a [ROLLBACK](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/) is equivalent to ROLLBACK AND CHAIN, so a new transaction starts straight away with the same isolation level as transaction that's just finished. If set to `RELEASE` or `2`, a [COMMIT](../../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/commit.md) statement is equivalent to COMMIT RELEASE, while a [ROLLBACK](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/) is equivalent to ROLLBACK RELEASE, so the server will disconnect after the transaction completes. Note that the transaction completion type only applies to explicit commits, not implicit commits.
* Commandline: `--completion-type=name`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `enumerated`
* Default Value: `NO_CHAIN`
* Valid Values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `NO_CHAIN`, `CHAIN`, `RELEASE`

#### `concurrent_insert`

* Description: If set to `AUTO` or `1`, the default, MariaDB allows [concurrent INSERTs](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/concurrent-inserts.md) and SELECTs for [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) tables with no free blocks in the data (deleted rows in the middle). If set to `NEVER` or `0`, concurrent inserts are disabled. If set to `ALWAYS` or `2`, concurrent inserts are permitted for all MyISAM tables, even those with holes, in which case new rows are added at the end of a table if the table is being used by another thread. If the [--skip-new](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-skip-new) option is used when starting the server, concurrent\_insert is set to `NEVER`. Changing the variable only affects new opened tables. Use [FLUSH TABLES](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush.md) If you want it to also affect cached tables. See [Concurrent Inserts](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/concurrent-inserts.md) for more.
* Commandline: `--concurrent-insert[=value]`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `enumerated`
* Default Value: `AUTO`
* Valid Values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `AUTO`, `NEVER`, `ALWAYS`

#### `connect_timeout`

* Description: Time in seconds that the server waits for a connect packet before returning a 'Bad handshake'. Increasing may help if clients regularly encounter 'Lost connection to MySQL server at 'X', system error: error\_number' type-errors.
* Commandline: `--connect-timeout=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: numeric
* Default Value: `10`
* Range: `2` to `31536000`

#### `core_file`

* Description: Write a core-file on crashes. The file name and location are system dependent. On Linux it is usually called `core.${PID}`, and it is usually written to the data directory. However, this can be changed.
  * See [Enabling Core Dumps](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/development-articles/debugging-mariadb/enabling-core-dumps) for more information.

* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `OFF` or `ON - current signal signal name`

#### `default_password_lifetime`

* Description: This defines the global [password expiration policy](../../../security/user-account-management/user-password-expiry.md). 0 means automatic password expiration is disabled. If the value is a positive integer N, the passwords must be changed every N days. This behavior can be overridden using the password expiration options in [ALTER USER](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/alter-user.md).

## comments |

\| EXTRA | (?X) | extra features (e.g. error on unknown escape character) |\
\| MULTILINE | (?m) | ^ and $ match newlines within data |\
\| UNGREEDY | (?U) | Invert greediness of quantifiers |

* Commandline: `--default-regex-flags=value`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: enumeration
* Default Value: empty
* Valid Values: `DOTALL`, `DUPNAMES`, `EXTENDED`, `EXTRA`, `MULTILINE`, `UNGREEDY`

#### `default_storage_engine`

* Commandline: `--default-storage-engine=name`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: enumeration
* Default Value: `InnoDB`

#### `default_table_type`

* Commandline: `--default-table-type=name`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Removed: [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/)

#### `default_tmp_storage_engine`

* Description: Default storage engine that will be used for tables created with [CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table.md) where no engine is specified. For internal temporary tables see [aria\_used\_for\_temp\_tables](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables.md#aria_used_for_temp_tables)). The storage engine used must be active or the server will not start. See [default\_storage\_engine](server-system-variables.md#default_storage_engine) for the default for non-temporary tables. Defaults to NULL, in which case the value from [default\_storage\_engine](server-system-variables.md#default_storage_engine) is used. [ROCKSDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myrocks/) temporary tables cannot be created. Before [MariaDB 10.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-7-series/what-is-mariadb-107), attempting to do so would silently fail, and a MyISAM table would instead be created. From [MariaDB 10.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-7-series/what-is-mariadb-107), an error is returned.

* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `enumeration`
* Default Value: NULL

#### `default_week_format`

* Description: Default mode for the [WEEK()](../../../reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/week.md) function. See that page for details on the different modes

* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `0`
* Range: `0` to `7`

#### `delay_key_write`

* Description: Specifies how MyISAM tables handles [CREATE TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table.md) DELAY\_KEY\_WRITE. If set to `ON`, the default, any DELAY KEY WRITEs are honored. The key buffer is then flushed only when the table closes, speeding up writes. MyISAM tables should be automatically checked upon startup in this case, and --external locking should not be used, as it can lead to index corruption. If set to `OFF`, DELAY KEY WRITEs are ignored, while if set to `ALL`, all new opened tables are treated as if created with DELAY KEY WRITEs enabled.
* Commandline: `--delay-key-write[=name]`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `enumeration`
* Default Value: `ON`
* Valid Values: `ON`, `OFF`, `ALL`

#### `delayed_insert_limit`

* Commandline: `--delayed-insert-timeout=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `300`

#### `delayed_queue_size`

* Description: Number of rows, per table, that can be queued when performing [INSERT DELAYED](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/insert-delayed.md) statements. If the queue becomes full, clients attempting to perform INSERT DELAYED's will wait until the queue has room available again.
* Commandline: `--delayed-queue-size=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: numeric
* Default Value: `1000`
* Range: `1 to 4294967295`

#### `disconnect_on_expired_password`

* Description: When a user password has expired (see [User Password Expiry](../../../security/user-account-management/user-password-expiry.md)), this variable controls how the server handles clients that are not aware of the sandbox mode. If enabled, the client is not permitted to connect, otherwise the server puts the client in a sandbox mode.
* Commandline: `--disconnect-on-expired-password[={0|1}]`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: boolean
* Default Value: `OFF`

#### `div_precision_increment`

* Description: The precision of the result of the decimal division will be the larger than the precision of the dividend by that number. By default it's `4`, so `SELECT 2/15` would return 0.1333 and `SELECT 2.0/15` would return 0.13333. After setting div\_precision\_increment to `6`, for example, the same operation would return 0.133333 and 0.1333333 respectively.

#### `enforce_storage_engine`

* Description: Force the use of a particular storage engine for new tables. Used to avoid unwanted creation of tables using another engine. For example, setting to [InnoDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) will prevent any [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) tables from being created. If another engine is specified in a [CREATE TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table.md) statement, the outcome depends on whether the `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION` [SQL\_MODE](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md) has been set or not. If set, the query will fail, while if not set, a warning will be returned and the table created according to the engine specified by this variable.

* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`

#### `flush_time`

* Description: If set to 1 (the default) [foreign key constraints](../optimization-and-indexes/foreign-keys.md) (including ON UPDATE and ON DELETE behavior) [InnoDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) tables are checked, while if set to 0, they are not checked. `0` is not recommended for normal use, though it can be useful in situations where you know the data is consistent, but want to reload data in a different order from that that specified by parent/child relationships. Setting this variable to 1 does not retrospectively check for inconsistencies introduced while set to 0.
* Commandline: None
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `1`

#### `ft_boolean_syntax`

* Description: List of operators supported by an IN BOOLEAN MODE [full-text search](../optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/). If you wish to change, note that each character must be ASCII and non-alphanumeric, the full string must be 14 characters and the first or second character must be a space (marking the behavior by default). Positions 10, 13 and 14 are reserved for future extensions. Also, no duplicates are permitted except for the phrase quoting characters in positions 11 and 12, which may be the same.
* Commandline: `--ft-boolean-syntax=name`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`

* Description: Maximum length for a word to be included in the [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) [full-text index](../optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/). If this variable is changed, the full-text index must be rebuilt in order for the new value to take effect. The quickest way to do this is by issuing a `REPAIR TABLE table_name QUICK` statement. See [innodb\_ft\_max\_token\_size](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_ft_max_token_size) for the [InnoDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) equivalent.

* Description: Minimum length for a word to be included in the [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) [full-text index](../optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/). If this variable is changed, the full-text index must be rebuilt in order for the new value to take effect. The quickest way to do this is by issuing a `REPAIR TABLE table_name QUICK` statement. See [innodb\_ft\_min\_token\_size](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_ft_min_token_size) for the [InnoDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) equivalent.

* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `20`
* Range: `0` to `1000`

#### `ft_stopword_file`

* Description: File containing a list of [stopwords](../optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/full-text-index-stopwords.md) for use in [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) [full-text searches](../optimization-and-indexes/full-text-indexes/). Unless an absolute path is specified the file will be looked for in the data directory. The file is not parsed for comments, so all words found become stopwords. By default, a built-in list of words (built from `storage/myisam/ft_static.c file`) is used. Stopwords can be disabled by setting this variable to `''` (an empty string). If this variable is changed, the full-text index must be rebuilt. The quickest way to do this is by issuing a `REPAIR TABLE table_name QUICK` statement. See [innodb\_ft\_server\_stopword\_table](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_ft_server_stopword_table) for the [InnoDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) equivalent.

See [log\_output](server-system-variables.md#log_output) for how log files are written. If that variable is set to `NONE`, no logs will be written even if general\_query\_log is set to `1`.
* Commandline: `--general-log`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `0`

#### `general_log_file`

* Description: Name of the [general query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/general-query-log.md) file. If this is not specified, the name is taken from the [log-basename](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-log-basename) setting or from your system hostname with `.log` as a suffix. If [--log-basename](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-log-basename) is also set, `general_log_file` should be placed after in the config files. Later settings override earlier settings, so `log-basename` will override any earlier log file name settings.
* Commandline: `--general-log-file=file_name`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `file name`
* Default Value: `host_name.log`

#### `group_concat_max_len`

#### `host_cache_size`

* Description: Number of host names that will be cached to avoid resolving. Setting to `0` disables the cache. Changing the value while the server is running causes an implicit [FLUSH HOSTS](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush.md), clearing the host cache and truncating the [performance\_schema.host\_cache](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-host_cache-table.md) table.

#### `join_buffer_size`

* Description: Minimum size in bytes of the buffer used for queries that cannot use an index, and instead perform a full table scan. Increase to get faster full joins when adding indexes is not possible, although be aware of memory issues, since joins will always allocate the minimum size. Best left low globally and set high in sessions that require large full joins. In 64-bit platforms, Windows truncates values above 4GB to 4GB with a warning. See also [Block-Based Join Algorithms - Size of Join Buffers](broken-reference/).
* Commandline: `--join-buffer-size=#`

#### `keep_files_on_create`

* Description: If a [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) table is created with no DATA DIRECTORY option, the .MYD file is stored in the database directory. When set to `0`, the default, if MariaDB finds another .MYD file in the database directory it will overwrite it. Setting this variable to `1` means that MariaDB will return an error instead, just as it usually does in the same situation outside of the database directory.

#### `large_files_support`

* Description: ON if the server if was compiled with large file support or not, else OFF
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No

#### `large_page_size`

* Description: Indicates the size of memory page if large page support (Linux only) is enabled. The page size is determined from the Hugepagesize setting in `/proc/meminfo`. See [large\_pages](server-system-variables.md#large_pages). Deprecated and unused in [MariaDB 10.5.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1053-release-notes) since multiple page size support was added.

#### `large_pages`

* Description: Indicates whether large page support (prior to [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105), Linux only, by now supported Windows and BSD distros, also called huge pages) is used. This is set with `--large-pages` or disabled with `--skip-large-pages`. Large pages are used for the [innodb buffer pool](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-buffer-pool.md) and for online DDL (of size 3\* [innodb\_sort\_buffer\_size](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_sort_buffer_size) (or 6 when encryption is used)). To use large pages, the Linux `sysctl` variable `kernel.shmmax` must be large than the llocation. Also the `sysctl` variable `vm.nr_hugepages` multipled by [large-page](server-system-variables.md#large_page_size)) must be larger than the usage. The ulimit for locked memory must be sufficient to cover the amount used (`ulimit -l` and equalivent in /etc/security/limits.conf / or in systemd [LimitMEMLOCK](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/systemd.md)). If these operating system controls or insufficient free huge pages are available, the allocation of large pages will fall back to conventional memory allocation and a warning will appear in the logs. Only allocations of the default `Hugepagesize` currently occur (see `/proc/meminfo`).
* Commandline: `--large-pages`, `--skip-large-pages`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`

#### `last_insert_id`

* Description: Contains the same value as that returned by [LAST\_INSERT\_ID()](../../../reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/last_insert_id.md). Note that setting this variable doen't update the value returned by the underlying function.
* Scope: Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`

#### `lc_messages`

* Description: This system variable can be specified as a [locale](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md) name. The language of the associated [locale](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md) will be used for error messages. See [Server Locales](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md) for a list of supported locales and their associated languages.
  * This system variable is set to `en_US` by default, which means that error messages are in English by default.
  * If this system variable is set to a valid [locale](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md) name, but the server can't find an [error message file](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file) for the language associated with the [locale](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md), then the default language will be used instead.
  * This system variable is used along with the `[lc_messages_dir](#lc_messages_dir)` system variable to construct the path to the [error messages file](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file).
  * See [Setting the Language for Error Messages](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/setting-the-language-for-error-messages.md) for more information.
* Commandline: `--lc-messages=name`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `en_us`

#### `lc_messages_dir`

* Description: This system variable can be specified either as the path to the directory storing the server's [error message files](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file) or as the path to the directory storing the specific language's [error message file](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file). See [Server Locales](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md) for a list of available locales and their related languages.
  * The server initially tries to interpret the value of this system variable as a path to the directory storing the server's [error message files](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file). Therefore, it constructs the path to the language's [error message file](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file) by concatenating the value of this system variable with the language name of the [locale](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md) specified by the `[lc_messages](server-system-variables.md#lc_messages)` system variable .
  * If the server does not find the [error message file](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file) for the language, then it tries to interpret the value of this system variable as a direct path to the directory storing the specific language's [error message file](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md#error-messages-file).
  * See [Setting the Language for Error Messages](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/setting-the-language-for-error-messages.md) for more information.

Locale names are language and region subtags, for example 'en\_ZA' (English - South Africa) or 'es\_US: Spanish - United States'. The default is always 'en-US' regardless of the system's locale setting. See [server locale](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/server-locale.md) for a full list of supported locales.
* Commandline: `--lc-time-names=name`
* Scope: Global, Session

If [--console](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-console) is specified later in the configuration (Windows only) or this option isn't specified, errors will be logged to stderr. If no name is provided, errors will still be logged to `hostname.err` in the `datadir` directory by default. If a configuration file sets `--log-error`, one can reset it with `--skip-log-error` (useful to override a system wide configuration file). MariaDB always writes its error log, but the destination is configurable. See [error log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/error-log.md) for details. Note that if [--log-basename](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-log-basename) is also set, `log_error` should be placed after in the config files. Later settings override earlier settings, so `log-basename` will override any earlier log file name settings.
* Commandline: `--log-error[=name]`, `--skip-log-error`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `file name`
* Default Value: (empty string)

#### `log_output`

* Description: How the output for the [general query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/general-query-log.md) and the [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/) is stored. By default written to file (`FILE`), it can also be stored in the [general\_log](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysqlgeneral_log-table.md) and [slow\_log](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-slow_log-table.md) tables in the mysql database (`TABLE`), or not stored at all (`NONE`). More than one option can be chosen at the same time, with `NONE` taking precedence if present. Logs will not be written if logging is not enabled. See [Writing logs into tables](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/writing-logs-into-tables.md), and the [slow\_query\_log](server-system-variables.md#slow_query_log) and [general\_log](server-system-variables.md#general_log) server system variables.
* Commandline: `--log-output=name`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `set`
* Default Value: `FILE`
* Valid Values: `TABLE`, `FILE` or `NONE`

#### `log_queries_not_using_indexes`

* Description: Queries that don't use an index, or that perform a full index scan where the index doesn't limit the number of rows, will be logged to the [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/) (regardless of time taken). The slow query log needs to be enabled for this to have an effect. Mapped to `log_slow_filter='not_using_index'` from [MariaDB 10.3.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-1031-release-notes).

#### `log_slow_filter`

* Description: Comma-delimited string (without spaces) containing one or more settings for filtering what is logged to the [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/). If a query matches one of the types listed in the filter, and takes longer than [long\_query\_time](server-system-variables.md#long_query_time), it will be logged(except for 'not\_using\_index' which is always logged if enabled, regardless of the time). Sets [log-slow-admin-statements](server-system-variables.md#log_slow_admin_statements) to ON. See also [log\_slow\_disabled\_statements](server-system-variables.md#log_slow_disabled_statements).
  * `admin` log [administrative](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/slow-query-log-overview.md#logging-slow-administrative-statements) queries (create, optimize, drop etc...)

#### `log_slow_query`

* Description: If set to 0, the default unless the --slow-query-log option is used, the [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/) is disabled, while if set to 1 (both global and session variables), the slow query log is enabled. Named [slow\_query\_log](server-system-variables.md#slow_query_log) before [MariaDB 10.11.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-0-release-notes), which is now an alias.

#### `log_slow_rate_limit`

* Description: The [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/) will log every this many queries. The default is `1`, or every query, while setting it to `20` would log every 20 queries, or five percent. Aims to reduce I/O usage and excessively large slow query logs.

The packet message buffer is initialized with the value from [net\_buffer\_length](server-system-variables.md#net_buffer_length), but can grow up to max\_allowed\_packet bytes. Set as large as the largest BLOB, in multiples of 1024. If this value is changed, it should be changed on the client side as well. See [slave\_max\_allowed\_packet](../../standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md) for a specific limit for replication purposes.
* Commandline: `--max-allowed-packet=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes (Global), No (Session)
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value:
  * `16777216` (16M)
  * `1073741824` (1GB) (client-side)
* Range: `1024` to `1073741824`

#### `max_connect_errors`

* Description: Limit to the number of successive failed connects from a host before the host is blocked from making further connections. The count for a host is reset to zero if they successfully connect. To unblock, flush the host cache with a [FLUSH HOSTS](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush.md) statement or [mariadb-admin flush-hosts](../../../clients-and-utilities/administrative-tools/mariadb-admin.md). The [performance\_schema.host\_cache](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-host_cache-table.md) table contains the status of the current hosts.
* Commandline: `--max-connect-errors=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `100`
* Range: `1` to `4294967295`

#### `max_connections`

* Description: The maximum number of simultaneous client connections. See also [Handling Too Many Connections](handling-too-many-connections.md). Note that this value affects the number of file descriptors required on the operating system. Minimum was changed from `1` to `10` to avoid possible unexpected results for the user ([MDEV-18252](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18252)). Note that MariaDB always has one reserved connection for a `SUPER` (or `CONNECTION ADMIN` user). Additionally it can listen on a separate port, so will be available even when the max\_connections limit is reached.
* Commandline: `--max-connections=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `151`
* Range: `10` to `100000`

#### `max_delayed_threads`

* Description: Limits to the number of [INSERT DELAYED](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/insert-delayed.md) threads. Once this limit is reached, the insert is handled as if there was no DELAYED attribute. If set to `0`, DELAYED is ignored entirely. The session value can only be set to `0` or to the same as the global value.
* Commandline: `--max-delayed-threads=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `20`
* Range: `0` to `16384`

#### `max_digest_length`

* Description: Maximum length considered for computing a statement digest, such as used by the [Performance Schema](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/performance-schema/) and query rewrite plugins. Statements that differ after this many bytes produce the same digest, and are aggregated for statistics purposes. The variable is allocated per session. Increasing will allow longer statements to be distinguished from each other, but increase memory use, while decreasing will reduce memory use, but more statements may become indistinguishable.
* Commandline: `--max-digest-length=#`
* Scope: Global,
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `1024`
* Range: `0` to `1048576`

#### `max_error_count`

* Description: Specifies the maximum number of messages stored for display by [SHOW ERRORS](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-errors.md) and [SHOW WARNINGS](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-warnings.md) statements.
* Commandline: `--max-error-count=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `64`
* Range: `0` to `65535`

#### `max_heap_table_size`

* Description: Maximum size in bytes for user-created [MEMORY](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md) tables. Setting the variable while the server is active has no effect on existing tables unless they are recreated or altered. The smaller of max\_heap\_table\_size and [tmp\_table\_size](server-system-variables.md#tmp_table_size) also limits internal in-memory tables. When the maximum size is reached, any further attempts to insert data will receive a "table ... is full" error. Temporary tables created with [CREATE TEMPORARY](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table.md) will not be converted to Aria, as occurs with internal temporary tables, but will also receive a table full error.
* Commandline: `--max-heap-table-size=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `16777216`
* Range : `16384` to `4294966272`

#### `max_insert_delayed_threads`

* Description: Synonym for [max\_delayed\_threads](server-system-variables.md#max_delayed_threads).

#### `max_join_size`

* Description: Statements will not be performed if they are likely to need to examine more than this number of rows, row combinations or do more disk seeks. Can prevent poorly-formatted queries from taking server resources. Changing this value to anything other the default will reset [sql\_big\_selects](server-system-variables.md#sql_big_selects) to 0. If sql\_big\_selects is set again, max\_join\_size will be ignored. This limit is also ignored if the query result is sitting in the [query cache](../buffers-caches-and-threads/query-cache.md). Previously named [sql\_max\_join\_size](server-system-variables.md#sql_max_join_size), which is still a synonym.
* Commandline: `--max-join-size=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `18446744073709551615`
* Range: `1` to `18446744073709551615`

#### `max_length_for_sort_data`

* Description: Used to decide which algorithm to choose when sorting rows. If the total size of the column data, not including columns that are part of the sort, is less than `max_length_for_sort_data`, then we add these to the sort key. This can speed up the sort as we don't have to re-read the same row again later. Setting the value too high can slow things down as there will be a higher disk activity for doing the sort.
* Commandline: `--max-length-for-sort-data=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `1024`
* Range: `4` to `8388608`

#### `max_long_data_size`

* Description: Maximum size for parameter values sent with mysql\_stmt\_send\_long\_data(). If not set, will default to the value of [max\_allowed\_packet](server-system-variables.md#max_allowed_packet). Deprecated in [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/) and removed in [MariaDB 10.5.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1050-release-notes); use [max\_allowed\_packet](server-system-variables.md#max_allowed_packet) instead.
* Commandline: `--max-long-data-size=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value:
  * `16777216` (16M)

#### `max_password_errors`

* Description: The maximum permitted number of failed connection attempts due to an invalid password before a user is blocked from further connections. [FLUSH\_PRIVILEGES](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush.md) will permit the user to connect again. This limit is not applicable for users with the [SUPER](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#super) privilege or, from [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes), the [CONNECTION ADMIN](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#connection-admin) privilege, with a hostname of localhost, 127.0.0.1 or ::1.

* Default Value: `131072`
* Range: `1024` to `18446744073709551615`

#### `max_seeks_for_key`

* Description: The optimizer assumes that the number specified here is the most key seeks required when searching with an index, regardless of the actual index cardinality. If this value is set lower than its default and maximum, indexes will tend to be preferred over table scans.
* Commandline: `--max-seeks-for-key=#`

* Range: `8192` to `18446744073709551615`

#### `max_sort_length`

* Description: Maximum size in bytes used for sorting data values - anything exceeding this is ignored. The server uses only the first `max_sort_length` bytes of each value and ignores the rest. Increasing this may require [sort\_buffer\_size](server-system-variables.md#sort_buffer_size) to be increased (especially if ER\_OUT\_OF\_SORTMEMORY errors start appearing). From [MariaDB 11.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-11-7-rolling-releases/what-is-mariadb-117), a warning is generated when max\_sort\_length is exceeded.

#### `max_sp_recursion_depth`

* Description: Permitted number of recursive calls for a [stored procedure](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-procedures/). `0`, the default, no recursion is permitted. Increasing this value increases the thread stack requirements, so you may need to increase [thread\_stack](server-system-variables.md#thread_stack) as well. This limit doesn't apply to [stored functions](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/stored-functions/).
* Commandline: `--max-sp-recursion-depth[=#]`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `0`
* Range: `0` to `255`

#### `max_statement_time`

* Description: Maximum time in seconds that a query can execute before being aborted. This includes all queries, not just [SELECT](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/select.md) statements, but excludes statements in stored procedures. If set to 0, no limit is applied. See [Aborting statements that take longer than a certain time to execute](../query-optimizations/aborting-statements.md) for details and limitations. Useful when combined with [SET STATEMENT](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set-statement.md) for limiting the execution times of individual queries. Replicas are not affected by this variable, however, from [MariaDB 10.10](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-10-series/what-is-mariadb-1010), there's [slave\_max\_statement\_time](../../standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md#slave_max_statement_time) that sets the limit to abort queries on a replica.

  Maximum simultaneous connections permitted for each user account. When set to `0`, there is no per user limit. Setting it to `-1` stops users without the [SUPER](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#super) privilege or, from [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes), the [CONNECTION ADMIN](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#connection-admin) privilege, from connecting to the server. The session variable is always read-only and only privileged users can modify user limits. The session variable defaults to the global `max_user_connections` variable, unless the user's specific `[MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS](../../../../reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/account-management-sql-commands/create-user.md#max_user_connections)` resource option is non-zero. When both global variable and the user resource option are set, the user's [MAX\_USER\_CONNECTIONS](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/create-user.md#max_user_connections) is used. Note: This variable does not affect users with the [SUPER](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#super) privilege or, from [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes), the [CONNECTION ADMIN](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#connection-admin) privilege.

#### `min_examined_row_limit`

* Description: Don't write queries to [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/) that examine fewer rows than the set value. If set to `0`, the default, no row limit is used. From [MariaDB 10.11.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-0-release-notes), this is an alias for [log\_slow\_min\_examined\_row\_limit](server-system-variables.md#log_slow_min_examined_row_limit).
* Commandline: `--min-examined-row-limit=#`

#### `mysql56_temporal_format`

* Description: If set (the default), MariaDB uses the MySQL 5.6 low level formats for [TIME](../../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/time.md), [DATETIME](../../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/datetime.md) and [TIMESTAMP](../../../reference/data-types/date-and-time-data-types/timestamp.md) instead of the [MariaDB 5.3](broken-reference/) version. The version MySQL introduced in 5.6 requires more storage, but potentially allows negative dates and has some advantages in replication. There should be no reason to revert to the old [MariaDB 5.3](broken-reference/) microsecond format. See also [MDEV-10723](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10723).
* Commandline: `--mysql56-temporal-format`

See also [Notes when an index cannot be used](broken-reference/). Be aware that if the old [sql\_notes](server-system-variables.md#sql_notes) variable is 0, one will not get any notes. Setting `note_verbosity` to "" is the recommended way to disable notes.
  * `basic` All old notes.
  * `unusable_keys` Give warnings for unusable keys for SELECT, DELETE and UPDATE.
  * `explain` Give warnings for unusable keys for EXPLAIN.
  * `all` Enables all above options. This has to be given alone.

#### `old_mode`

* Description: Used for getting MariaDB to emulate behavior from an old version of MySQL or MariaDB. See [OLD Mode](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/old-mode.md). Fully replaces the [old](server-system-variables.md#old) variable from [MariaDB 10.9](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-9-series/what-is-mariadb-109). Non-default OLD\_MODE options are by design deprecated and will eventually be removed.
* Commandline: `--old-mode`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `UTF8_IS_UTF8MB3` (>= [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106)) `(empty string)` (<= [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105))
* Valid Values: See [OLD Mode](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/old-mode.md) for the full list.

#### `old_passwords`

* Description: If set to `1` (`0` is default), MariaDB reverts to using the `[mysql_old_password](../../../../reference/plugins/authentication-plugins/authentication-plugin-mysql_old_password.md)` authentication plugin by default for newly created users and passwords, instead of the `[mysql_native_password](../../../../reference/plugins/authentication-plugins/authentication-plugin-mysql_native_password.md)` authentication plugin.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`

#### `open_files_limit`

* Description: The number of file descriptors available to MariaDB. If you are getting the `Too many open files` error, then you should increase this limit. If set to 0, then MariaDB will calculate a limit based on the following:

MAX([max\_connections](server-system-variables.md#max_connections)\*5, [max\_connections](server-system-variables.md#max_connections) +[table\_open\_cache](server-system-variables.md#table_open_cache)\*2)

MariaDB sets the limit with `[setrlimit](https://linux.die.net/man/2/setrlimit)`. MariaDB cannot set this to exceed the hard limit imposed by the operating system. Therefore, you may also need to change the hard limit. There are a few ways to do so.

* If you are using `[mariadbd_safe](../../../../clients-and-utilities/legacy-clients-and-utilities/mariadbd_safe.md)` to start `mariadbd`, then see the instructions at [mariadbd\_safe: Configuring the Open Files Limit](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-safe.md#configuring-the-open-files-limit).
* If you are using `[systemd](../../../../server-management/getting-installing-and-upgrading-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/systemd.md)` to start `mariadbd`, then see the instructions at [systemd: Configuring the Open Files Limit](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/systemd.md#configuring-the-open-files-limit).
* Otherwise, you can change the hard limit for the `mysql` user account by modifying `[/etc/security/limits.conf](https://linux.die.net/man/5/limits.conf)`. See [Configuring Linux for MariaDB: Configuring the Open Files Limit](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/mariadb-performance-advanced-configurations/configuring-linux-for-mariadb.md#configuring-the-open-files-limit) for more details.

#### `optimizer_max_sel_arg_weight`

* Description: This is an actively enforced maximum effective SEL\_ARG tree weight limit. A SEL\_ARG weight is the number of effective "ranges" hanging off this root (that is, merged tree elements are "unmerged" to count the weight). During range analysis, looking for possible index merges, SEL\_ARG graphs related to key ranges in query conditions are being processed. Graphs exceeding this limit will stop keys being 'and'ed and 'or'ed together to form a new larger SEL\_ARG graph. After each 'and' or 'or' process, this maximum weight limit is enforced. It enforces this limit by pruning the key part being used. This key part pruning can be used to limit/disable index merge SEL\_ARG graph construction on overly long query conditions.\
  See [optimizer\_max\_sel\_arg\_weight](broken-reference/) for details.

#### `optimizer_prune_level`

* Description:Controls the heuristic(s) applied during query optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from the optimizer search space.
  * `0`: heuristics are disabled and an exhaustive search is performed
  * `1`: the optimizer will use heuristics to prune less-promising partial plans from the optimizer search space
  * `2`: tables using EQ\_REF will be joined together as 'one entity' and the different combinations of these tables will not be considered (from [MariaDB 10.10](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-10-series/what-is-mariadb-1010))

#### `optimizer_search_depth`

* Description: Maximum search depth by the query optimizer. Smaller values lead to less time spent on execution plans, but potentially less optimal results. If set to `0`, MariaDB will automatically choose a reasonable value. Since the better results from more optimal planning usually offset the longer time spent on planning, this is set as high as possible by default. `63` is a valid value, but its effects (switching to the original find\_best search) are deprecated.

#### `query_cache_size`

* Description: Size in bytes available to the [query cache](../buffers-caches-and-threads/query-cache.md). About 40KB is needed for query cache structures, so setting a size lower than this will result in a warning. `0`, the default before [MariaDB 10.1.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/mariadb-10-1-7-release-notes), effectively disables the query cache.

**Warning:** Starting from [MariaDB 10.1.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/mariadb-10-1-7-release-notes), [query\_cache\_type](server-system-variables.md#query_cache_type) is automatically set to ON if the server is started with the query\_cache\_size set to a non-zero (and non-default) value. This will happen even if [query\_cache\_type](server-system-variables.md#query_cache_type) is explicitly set to OFF in the configuration.

* Commandline: `--query-cache-size=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `1M` (although frequently given a default value in some setups)
* Valid Values: `0` upwards in units of 1024.

#### `query_cache_strip_comments`

* Description: If set to `1` (`0` is default), the server will strip any comments from the query before searching to see if it exists in the [query cache](../buffers-caches-and-threads/query-cache.md). Multiple space, line feeds, tab and other white space characters will also be removed.
* Commandline: `query-cache-strip-comments`
* Scope: Session, Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`

#### `query_cache_type`

* Description: If set to `0`, the [query cache](../buffers-caches-and-threads/query-cache.md) is disabled (although a buffer of [query\_cache\_size](server-system-variables.md#query_cache_size) bytes is still allocated). If set to `1` all SELECT queries will be cached unless SQL\_NO\_CACHE is specified. If set to `2` (or `DEMAND`), only queries with the SQL CACHE clause will be cached. Note that if the server is started with the query cache disabled, it cannot be enabled at runtime.

**Warning:** Starting from [MariaDB 10.1.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/mariadb-10-1-7-release-notes), query\_cache\_type is automatically set to ON if the server is started with the [query\_cache\_size](server-system-variables.md#query_cache_size) set to a non-zero (and non-default) value. This will happen even if [query\_cache\_type](server-system-variables.md#query_cache_type) is explicitly set to OFF in the configuration.

* Commandline: `--query-cache-type=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `enumeration`
* Default Value: `OFF`
* Valid Values: `0` or `OFF`, `1` or `ON`, `2` or `DEMAND`

#### `query_cache_wlock_invalidate`

* Description: If set to `0`, the default, results present in the [query cache](../buffers-caches-and-threads/query-cache.md) will be returned even if there's a write lock on the table. If set to `1`, the client will first have to wait for the lock to be released.
* Commandline: `--query-cache-wlock-invalidate`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`

#### `query_prealloc_size`

* Description: Size in bytes of the persistent buffer for query parsing and execution, allocated on connect and freed on disconnect. Increasing may be useful if complex queries are being run, as this will reduce the need for more memory allocations during query operation. See also [query\_alloc\_block\_size](server-system-variables.md#query_alloc_block_size).
* Commandline: `--query-prealloc-size=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `24576`
* Range: `1024` to `4294967295`

#### `rand_seed1`

* Description: `rand_seed1` and `rand_seed2` facilitate replication of the [RAND()](../../../reference/sql-functions/numeric-functions/rand.md) function. The master passes the value of these to the slaves so that the random number generator is seeded in the same way, and generates the same value, on the slave as on the master. Until [MariaDB 10.1.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/mariadb-10-1-4-release-notes), the variable value could not be viewed, with the [SHOW VARIABLES](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-variables.md) output always displaying zero.
* Commandline: None

#### `read_buffer_size`

* Description: Each thread performing a sequential scan (for MyISAM, Aria and MERGE tables) allocates a buffer of this size in bytes for each table scanned. Increase if you perform many sequential scans. If not in a multiple of 4KB, will be rounded down to the nearest multiple. Also used in ORDER BY's for caching indexes in a temporary file (not temporary table), for caching results of nested queries, for bulk inserts into partitions, and to determine the memory block size of [MEMORY](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md) tables.
* Commandline: `--read-buffer-size=#`

The `read_only` variable is useful for replica servers to ensure no updates are accidentally made outside of what are performed on the primary. Inserting rows to log tables, updates to temporary tables and [OPTIMIZE TABLE](../optimizing-tables/optimize-table.md) or [ANALYZE TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/table-statements/analyze-table.md) statements are excluded from this limitation. If `read_only` is set to `1`, then the [SET PASSWORD](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/set-password.md) statement is limited only to users with the [SUPER](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#super) privilege (<= [MariaDB 10.5.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1051-release-notes)) or [READ ONLY ADMIN](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#read_only-admin) privilege (>= [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes)). Attempting to set this variable to `1` will fail if the current session has table locks or transactions pending, while if other sessions hold table locks, the statement will wait until these locks are released before completing. While the attempt to set `read_only` is waiting, other requests for table locks or transactions will also wait until `read_only` has been set. See [Read-Only Replicas](../../standard-replication/read-only-replicas.md) for more. From [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes), the [READ\_ONLY ADMIN](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#read_only-admin) privilege will allow users granted that privilege to perform writes, even if the `read_only` variable is set. In earlier versions, and until [MariaDB 10.11.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-11-series/mariadb-10-11-0-release-notes), users with the [SUPER](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#super) can perform writes while this variable is set.

Otherwise, it will use the `[fcntl()](https://linux.die.net/man/2/fcntl)` function with the `F_SETLK` option to get file-based locks on Unix, and it will use the `[LockFileEx()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-lockfileex)` function to get file-based locks on Windows.
  * If this system variable is set, then the [Aria](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/) storage engine will not lock a table when it decrements the table's in-file counter that keeps track of how many connections currently have the table open. See [MDEV-19393](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19393) for more information.
  * Note that command line option name is the opposite of the variable name, and the value is the opposite too. `--external-locking=1` means `@@skip_external_locking=0`, and vice versa.

* Description: Name of the [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/) file. From [MariaDB 10.11](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-11-series/what-is-mariadb-1011), an alias for [log\_slow\_query\_file](server-system-variables.md#log_slow_query_file). If [--log-basename](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-log-basename) is also set, `slow_query_log_file` should be placed after in the config files. Later settings override earlier settings, so `log-basename` will override any earlier log file name settings.
* Commandline: `--slow-query-log-file=file_name`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `file name`
* Default Value: `host_name-slow.log`

#### `socket`

* Description: On Unix-like systems, this is the name of the socket file used for local client connections, by default `/tmp/mysql.sock`, often changed by the distribution, for example `/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock`. On Windows, this is the name of the named pipe used for local client connections, by default `MySQL`. On Windows, this is not case-sensitive.
* Commandline: `--socket=name`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `file name`
* Default Value: `/tmp/mysql.sock` (Unix), `MySQL` (Windows)

#### `sort_buffer_size`

* Description: Each session performing a sort allocates a buffer with this amount of memory. Not specific to any storage engine. If the status variable [sort\_merge\_passes](server-status-variables.md#sort_merge_passes) is too high, you may need to look at improving your query indexes, or increasing this. Consider reducing where there are many small sorts, such as OLTP, and increasing where needed by session. 16k is a suggested minimum.
* Commandline: `--sort-buffer-size=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `number`
* Default Value: `2M (2097152)` (some distributions increase the default)

#### `sql_auto_is_null`

* Description: If set to 1, the query `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE auto_increment_column IS NULL` will return an auto-increment that has just been successfully inserted, the same as the LAST\_INSERT\_ID() function. Some ODBC programs make use of this IS NULL comparison.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `0`

#### `sql_big_selects`

* Description: If set to 0, MariaDB will not perform large SELECTs. See [max\_join\_size](server-system-variables.md#max_join_size) for details. If max\_join\_size is set to anything but DEFAULT, sql\_big\_selects is automatically set to 0. If sql\_big\_selects is again set, max\_join\_size will be ignored.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `1`

#### `sql_big_tables`

* Description: Old variable, which if set to 1, allows large result sets by saving all temporary sets to disk, avoiding 'table full' errors. No longer needed, as the server now handles this automatically.
  * This is a synonym for `[big_tables](#big_tables)`.
* Commandline: `--sql-big-tables`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `0`
* Removed: [MariaDB 10.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0)

#### `sql_buffer_result`

* Description: If set to 1 (0 is default), results from SELECT statements are always placed into temporary tables. This can help the server when it takes a long time to send the results to the client by allowing the table locks to be freed early.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `0`

#### `sql_if_exists`

* Description: If set to 1, adds an implicit IF EXISTS to ALTER, RENAME and DROP of TABLES, VIEWS, FUNCTIONS and PACKAGES. This variable is mainly used in replication to tag DDLs that can be ignored on the slave if the target table doesn't exist.
* Commandline: `--sql-if-exists[={0|1}]`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`
* Introduced: [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes)

#### `sql_log_off`

* Description: If set to 1 (0 is the default), no logging to the [general query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/general-query-log.md) is done for the client. Only clients with the [SUPER](../../../reference/sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#super) privilege can update this variable.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `0`

#### `sql_log_update`

* Description: Removed. Use [sql\_log\_bin](server-system-variables.md#sql_log_bin) instead.

#### `sql_low_priority_updates`

* Description: If set to 1 (0 is the default), for [storage engines](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/) that use only table-level locking ([Aria](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/), [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/), [MEMORY](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md) and [MERGE](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/merge.md)), all INSERTs, UPDATEs, DELETEs and LOCK TABLE WRITEs will wait until there are no more SELECTs or LOCK TABLE READs pending on the relevant tables. Set this to 1 if reads are prioritized over writes.
  * This is a synonym for `[low_priority_updates](#low_priority_updates)`.
* Commandline: `--sql-low-priority-updates`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `0`
* Removed: [MariaDB 10.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0)

#### `sql_max_join_size`

* Description: Synonym for [max\_join\_size](server-system-variables.md#max_join_size), the preferred name.
* Deprecated: [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/)
* Removed: [MariaDB 10.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0)

* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value:
  * `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`
* Valid Values: See [SQL Mode](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md) for the full list.

#### `sql_notes`

* Description: If set to 1, the default, [warning\_count](server-system-variables.md#warning_count) is incremented each time a Note warning is encountered. If set to 0, Note warnings are not recorded. [mariadb-dump](../../../clients-and-utilities/backup-restore-and-import-clients/mariadb-dump.md) has outputs to set this variable to 0 so that no unnecessary increments occur when data is reloaded. See also [note\_verbosity](server-system-variables.md#note_verbosity), which defines which notes should be given. The recommended way, as of [MariaDB 10.6.16](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-6-series/mariadb-10-6-16-release-notes), to disable notes is to set `note_verbosity` to "".
* Commandline: None
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `1`

#### `sql_quote_show_create`

* Description: If set to 1, the default, the server will quote identifiers for [SHOW CREATE DATABASE](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-create-database.md), [SHOW CREATE TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-create-table.md) and [SHOW CREATE VIEW](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-create-view.md) statements. Quoting is disabled if set to 0. Enable to ensure replication works when identifiers require quoting.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `1`

#### `sql_safe_updates`

* Description: If set to 1, UPDATEs and DELETEs must be executed by using an index (simply mentioning an indexed column in a WHERE clause is not enough, optimizer must actually use it) or they must mention an indexed column and specify a LIMIT clause. Otherwise a statement will be aborted. Prevents the common mistake of accidentally deleting or updating every row in a table. Until [MariaDB 10.3.11](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-10311-release-notes), could not be set as a command-line option or in my.cnf.
* Commandline: `--sql-safe-updates[={0|1}]`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`

#### `sql_select_limit`

* Description: Maximum number of rows that can be returned from a SELECT query. Default is the maximum number of rows permitted per table by the server, usually 232-1 or 264-1. Can be restored to the default value after being changed by assigning it a value of DEFAULT. If a SELECT has a LIMIT clause, the LIMIT takes precedence over the value of the variable.
* Commandline: None
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `18446744073709551615`

#### `sql_warnings`

* Description: If set to 1, single-row INSERTs will produce a string containing warning information if a warning occurs.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF (0)`

#### `storage_engine`

* Description: See [default\_storage\_engine](server-system-variables.md#default_storage_engine).
* Deprecated: [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/)

#### `standard_compliant_cte`

* Description: Allow only standard-compliant [common table expressions](../../../reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/common-table-expressions/). Prior to [MariaDB 10.2.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-1024-release-notes), this variable was named `standards_compliant_cte`.
* Commandline: `--standard-compliant-cte={0|1}`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `ON`

#### `stored_program_cache`

* Description: Limit to the number of [stored routines](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/) held in the stored procedures and stored functions caches. Each time a stored routine is executed, this limit is first checked, and if the number held in the cache exceeds this, that cache is flushed and memory freed.
* Commandline: `--stored-program-cache=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `256`
* Range: `256` to `524288`

#### `strict_password_validation`

* Description: When [password validation](broken-reference/) plugins are enabled, reject passwords that cannot be validated (passwords specified as a hash). This excludes direct updates to the privilege tables.
* Commandline: `--strict-password-validation`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `ON`

#### `sync_frm`

* Description: If set to 1, the default, each time a non-temporary table is created, its .frm definition file is synced to disk. Fractionally slower, but safer in case of a crash.
* Commandline: `--sync-frm`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `TRUE`

#### `system_time_zone`

* Description: The system time zone is determined when the server starts. The system [time zone](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/time-zones.md) is usually read from the operating system's environment but can be overridden by setting the 'TZ' environment variable before starting the server. See [Time Zones: System Time Zone](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/time-zones.md#system-time-zone) for the various ways to change the system time zone. This variable is not the same as the [time\_zone](server-system-variables.md#time_zone) system variable, which is the variable that actually controls a session's active time zone. The system time zone is used for a session when `time_zone` is set to the special value `SYSTEM`.
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `string`

#### `table_definition_cache`

* Description: Number of table definitions that can be cached. Table definitions are taken from the .frm files, and if there are a large number of tables increasing the cache size can speed up table opening. Unlike the [table\_open\_cache](server-system-variables.md#table_open_cache), as the table\_definition\_cache doesn't use file descriptors, and is much smaller.
* Commandline: `--table-definition-cache=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `400`
* Range: `400` to `2097152`

#### `table_lock_wait_timeout`

* Description: Unused, and removed.
* Commandline: `--table-lock-wait-timeout=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `50`
* Range: `1` to `1073741824`
* Removed: [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/)

#### `table_open_cache`

* Description: Maximum number of open tables cached in one table cache instance. See [Optimizing table\_open\_cache](optimizing-table_open_cache.md) for suggestions on optimizing. Increasing table\_open\_cache increases the number of file descriptors required.
* Commandline: `--table-open-cache=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `2000`
* Range:
  * `1` to `1048576` (1024K)

#### `table_open_cache_instances`

* Description: This system variable specifies the maximum number of table cache instances. MariaDB Server initially creates just a single instance. However, whenever it detects contention on the existing instances, it will automatically create a new instance. When the number of instances has been increased due to contention, it does not decrease again. The default value of this system variable is `8`, which is expected to handle up to 100 CPU cores. If your system is larger than this, then you may benefit from increasing the value of this system variable.
  * Depending on the ratio of actual available file handles, and `[table_open_cache](server-system-variables.md#table_open_cache)` size, the max. instance count may be auto adjusted to a lower value on server startup.
  * The implementation and behavior of this feature is different than the same feature in MySQL 5.6.
  * See [Optimizing table\_open\_cache: Automatic Creation of New Table Open Cache Instances](optimizing-table_open_cache.md#automatic-creation-of-new-table-open-cache-instances) for more information.
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `8` (>= [MariaDB 10.2.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-1022-release-notes))
* Range: `1` to `64`

#### `table_type`

* Description: Removed and replaced by [storage\_engine](server-system-variables.md#storage_engine). Use [default\_storage\_engine](server-system-variables.md#default_storage_engine) instead.

#### `tcp_keepalive_interval`

* Description: The interval, in seconds, between when successive keep-alive packets are sent if no acknowledgement is received. If set to 0, the system dependent default is used.
* Commandline: `--tcp-keepalive-interval=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `0`
* Range: `0` to `2147483`

#### `tcp_keepalive_probes`

* Description: The number of unacknowledged probes to send before considering the connection dead and notifying the application layer. If set to 0, a system dependent default is used.
* Commandline: `--tcp-keepalive-probes=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `0`
* Range: `0` to `2147483`

#### `tcp_keepalive_time`

* Description: Timeout, in seconds, with no activity until the first TCP keep-alive packet is sent. If set to 0, a system dependent default is used.
* Commandline: `--tcp-keepalive-time=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `0`
* Range: `0` to `2147483`

#### `tcp_nodelay`

* Description: Set the TCP\_NODELAY option (disable Nagle's algorithm) on socket.
* Commandline: `--tcp-nodelay={0|1}`
* Scope: Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `1`

#### `thread_cache_size`

* Description: Number of threads server caches for re-use. If this limit hasn't been reached, when a client disconnects, its threads are put into the cache, and re-used where possible. In [MariaDB 10.2.0](broken-reference/) and newer the threads are freed after 5 minutes of idle time. Normally this setting has little effect, as the other aspects of the thread implementation are more important, but increasing it can help servers with high volumes of connections per second so that most can use a cached, rather than a new, thread. The cache miss rate can be calculated as the [server status variables](server-status-variables.md) threads\_created/connections. If the [thread pool](../buffers-caches-and-threads/thread-pool/) is active, `thread_cache_size` is ignored. If `thread_cache_size` is set to greater than the value of [max\_connections](server-system-variables.md#max_connections), `thread_cache_size` will be set to the [max\_connections](server-system-variables.md#max_connections) value.
* Commandline: `--thread-cache-size=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `256` (adjusted if thread pool is active)
* Range: `0` to `16384`

#### `thread_concurrency`

* Description: Allows applications to give the system a hint about the desired number of threads. Specific to Solaris only, invokes thr\_setconcurrency(). Deprecated and has no effect from [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/).
* Commandline: `--thread-concurrency=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `10`
* Range: `1` to `512`
* Deprecated: [MariaDB 5.5](broken-reference/)
* Removed: [MariaDB 10.5.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1051-release-notes)

#### `thread_stack`

* Description: Stack size for each thread. If set too small, limits recursion depth of stored procedures and complexity of SQL statements the server can handle in memory. Also affects limits in the crash-me test.
* Commandline: `--thread-stack=#`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value:
  * `299008`
* Range: `131072` to `18446744073709551615`

#### `time_format`

* Description: Unused.
* Removed: [MariaDB 11.3.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-3-rolling-releases/mariadb-11-3-0-release-notes)

#### `time_zone`

* Description: The global value determines the default [time zone](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/time-zones.md) for sessions that connect. The session value determines the session's active [time zone](../../../reference/data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/internationalization-and-localization/time-zones.md). When it is set to `SYSTEM`, the session's time zone is determined by the `[system_time_zone](#system_time_zone)` system variable.
* Commandline: `--default-time-zone=string`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `string`
* Default Value: `SYSTEM`

#### `timed_mutexes`

* Description: Determines whether [InnoDB](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/) mutexes are timed. `OFF`, the default, disables mutex timing, while `ON` enables it. See also [SHOW ENGINE](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-engine.md) for more on mutex statistics. Deprecated and has no effect.
* Commandline: `--timed-mutexes`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `boolean`
* Default Value: `OFF`
* Deprecated: [MariaDB 5.5.39](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/mariadb-5539-release-notes)
* Removed: [MariaDB 10.5.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1051-release-notes)

#### `timestamp`

* Description: Sets the time for the client. This will affect the result returned by the [NOW()](../../../reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/now.md) function, not the [SYSDATE()](../../../reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/sysdate.md) function, unless the server is started with the [--sysdate-is-now](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md) option, in which case SYSDATE becomes an alias of NOW, and will also be affected. Also used to get the original timestamp when restoring rows from the [binary log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/).
* Scope: Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Valid Values: `timestamp_value` (Unix epoch timestamp, not MariaDB timestamp), `DEFAULT`

#### `tmp_disk_table_size`

* Description: Max size for data for an internal temporary on-disk [MyISAM](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) or [Aria](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/) table. These tables are created as part of complex queries when the result doesn't fit into the memory engine. You can set this variable if you want to limit the size of temporary tables created in your temporary directory [tmpdir](server-system-variables.md#tmpdir).
* Commandline: `--tmp-disk-table-size=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `numeric`
* Default Value: `18446744073709551615` (max unsigned integer, no limit)
* Range: `1024` to `18446744073709551615`

#### `tmp_memory_table_size`

* Description: An alias for [tmp\_table\_size](server-system-variables.md#tmp_table_size).
* Commandline: `--tmp-memory-table-size=#`

#### `tmp_table_size`

* Description: The largest size for temporary tables in memory (not [MEMORY](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md) tables) although if [max\_heap\_table\_size](server-system-variables.md#max_heap_table_size) is smaller the lower limit will apply. You can see if it's necessary to increase by comparing the [status variables](server-status-variables.md) `Created_tmp_disk_tables` and `Created_tmp_tables` to see how many temporary tables out of the total created needed to be converted to disk. Often complex GROUP BY queries are responsible for exceeding the limit. Defaults may be different on some systems, see for example [Differences in MariaDB in Debian](../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/troubleshooting-installation-issues/installation-issues-on-debian-and-ubuntu/differences-in-mariadb-in-debian-and-ubuntu.md). From [MariaDB 10.2.7](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/mariadb-1027-release-notes), [tmp\_memory\_table\_size](server-system-variables.md#tmp_memory_table_size) is an alias.

#### `tmpdir`

* Description: Directory for storing temporary tables and files. Can specify a list (separated by semicolons in Windows, and colons in Unix) that will then be used in round-robin fashion. This can be used for load balancing across several disks. Note that if the server is a [replication](broken-reference/) replica, and [slave\_load\_tmpdir](../../standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md#slave_load_tmpdir), which overrides `tmpdir` for replicas, is not set, you should not set `tmpdir` to a directory that is cleared when the machine restarts, or else replication may fail.
* Commandline: `--tmpdir=path` or `-t path`
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Type: directory name/s
* Default:
  * `$TMPDIR` (environment variable) if set

#### `transaction_prealloc_size`

* Description: Initial size of a memory pool available to each transaction for various memory allocations. If the memory pool is not large enough for an allocation, it is increased by [transaction\_alloc\_block\_size](server-system-variables.md#transaction_alloc_block_size) bytes, and truncated back to transaction\_prealloc\_size bytes when the transaction is completed. If set large enough to contain all statements in a transaction, extra malloc() calls are avoided.

#### `transaction_read_only`

* Description: Default transaction access mode. If set to `OFF`, the default, access is read/write. If set to `ON`, access is read-only. The `SET TRANSACTION` statement can also change the value of this variable. See [SET TRANSACTION](../../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/set-transaction.md) and [START TRANSACTION](../../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/start-transaction.md).

To set for a session, use `SET SESSION tx_isolation` or `SET @@session.tx_isolation`. See [MDEV-31751](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31751). See also [SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL](../../../reference/sql-statements/transactions/set-transaction.md). In [MariaDB 11.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/mariadb-community-server-release-notes/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-1-series/what-is-mariadb-111), this system variable is deprecated and replaced by [transaction\_isolation](server-system-variables.md#transaction_isolation).

#### `unique_checks`

* Description: If set to 0, storage engines can (but are not required to) assume that duplicate keys are not present in input data. If set to 0, inserting duplicates into a `UNIQUE` index can succeed, causing the table to become corrupted. Set to 0 to speed up imports of large tables to InnoDB.
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: boolean
* Default Value: `1`

#### `updatable_views_with_limit`

* Description: Determines whether view updates can be made with an UPDATE or DELETE statement with a LIMIT clause if the view does not contain all primary or not null unique key columns from the underlying table. `0` prohibits this, while `1` permits it while issuing a warning (the default).
* Commandline: `--updatable-views-with-limit=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Type: boolean
* Default Value: `1`

#### `use_stat_tables`

* Description: Controls the use of [engine-independent table statistics](../query-optimizations/statistics-for-optimizing-queries/engine-independent-table-statistics.md).
  * `never`: The optimizer will not use data from statistics tables.
  * `complementary`: The optimizer uses data from statistics tables if the same kind of data is not provided by the storage engine.
  * `preferably`: Prefer the data from statistics tables, if it's not available there, use the data from the storage engine.
  * `complementary_for_queries`: Same as `complementary`, but for queries only (to avoid needlessly collecting for [ANALYZE TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/table-statements/analyze-table.md)).
  * `preferably_for_queries`: Same as `preferably`, but for queries only (to avoid needlessly collecting for [ANALYZE TABLE](../../../reference/sql-statements/table-statements/analyze-table.md)).

* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
* Data Type: `enum`
* Default Value: `preferably_for_queries`

#### `version`

* Description: Server version number. It may also include a suffix with configuration or build information. `-debug` indicates debugging support was enabled on the server, and `-log` indicates at least one of the binary log, general log or [slow query log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/slow-query-log/) are enabled, for example `10.0.1-MariaDB-mariadb1precise-log`. Can be set at startup in order to fake the server version.

* Description: Source control revision id for MariaDB source code, enabling one to see exactly which version of the source was used for a build.
* Commandline: None
* Scope: Global
* Dynamic: No
* Type: string

#### `wait_timeout`

* Description: Time in seconds that the server waits for a connection to become active before closing it. The session value is initialized when a thread starts up from either the global value, if the connection is non-interactive, or from the [interactive\_timeout](server-system-variables.md#interactive_timeout) value, if the connection is interactive.
* Commandline: `--wait-timeout=#`
* Scope: Global, Session
* Dynamic: Yes
