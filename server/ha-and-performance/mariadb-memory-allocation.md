# MariaDB Memory Allocation

## Quick Recommendations

{% hint style="info" %}
Size MariaDB against **available RAM**, not total installed RAM.

On a dedicated host, available RAM means total RAM minus operating system needs and other running services. In containers or VMs, use the effective memory limit and leave headroom for the OS, filesystem cache, and temporary per-connection allocations.
{% endhint %}

Start with these defaults, depending on [your choice of storage engines](../server-usage/storage-engines/storage-engines-storage-engines-overview.md#overview):

* **Mostly InnoDB:** Set [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_buffer_pool_size) to about 60% to 70% of available RAM. Keep [key\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md#key_buffer_size) small, such as `16M` to `64M`, unless you use MyISAM indexes.
* **Mostly** [**MyISAM**](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/)**:** Set [key\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md#key_buffer_size) to about 20% of available RAM. Set [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_buffer_pool_size) to `0` only if you do not use InnoDB at all.
* **Mixed engines:** Prioritize InnoDB first. Then size [key\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md#key_buffer_size) to actual MyISAM index usage.
* Hosts with less than 4 GB of RAM: Use lower percentages and leave extra headroom.

Use these as starting points:

* Start from the packaged `my.cnf` or `my.ini`.
* Change only the major cache settings first.
* Fix slow queries with indexes, schema changes, or query changes before tuning smaller buffers.
* Keep the settings in the `[mariadb]` section.
* Restart the server after file-based changes.

Memory problems usually come from one of two causes:

* Global caches are too large.
* Per-connection buffers are too large for the current concurrency.

## How MariaDB Uses Memory

MariaDB uses three broad kinds of memory:

* **Fixed global allocations**
  * Storage engine caches such as [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_buffer_pool_size), [key\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md#key_buffer_size) and [aria\_pagecache\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables.md#aria_pagecache_buffer_size).
  * Optional caches such as [query\_cache\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_cache_size).
* **Dynamic global structures**
  * Metadata- and connection-related structures such as [table\_open\_cache](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#table_open_cache), [table\_definition\_cache](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#table_definition_cache), and [thread\_cache\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#thread_cache_size).
  * Limits such as [max\_connections](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_connections) do not allocate memory by themselves, but they raise the possible peak memory footprint.
* **Per-connection and per-query allocations**
  * Execution buffers such as [join\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#join_buffer_size), [mrr\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#mrr_buffer_size), [read\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#read_buffer_size), and [sort\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#sort_buffer_size).
  * Temporary in-memory tables controlled by [max\_heap\_table\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_heap_table_size) and [tmp\_memory\_table\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#tmp_memory_table_size).
  * Temporary blob storage and engine-specific work areas.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On containers, cgroups[^1], or managed environments, use the memory limit seen by MariaDB. Do not size caches against the physical RAM of the host.
{% endhint %}

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Confirm memory pressure.

Check whether the host is swapping or being killed by the [OOM killer](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

On the MariaDB side, inspect overall memory use:

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'memory_used';
```

If the server is swapping, reduce major caches before tuning anything else.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Review non-default variables.

List variables that differ from the compiled defaults:

```sql
SELECT information_schema.system_variables.variable_name,
       information_schema.system_variables.default_value,
       information_schema.global_variables.variable_value
FROM information_schema.system_variables
JOIN information_schema.global_variables
  ON information_schema.system_variables.variable_name =
     information_schema.global_variables.variable_name
WHERE information_schema.system_variables.default_value <>
      information_schema.global_variables.variable_value
  AND information_schema.system_variables.default_value <> 0;
```

This can yield a result like this:

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```
+-----------------------------+---------------+----------------+
| variable_name               | default_value | variable_value |
+-----------------------------+---------------+----------------+
| BACK_LOG                    | 150           | 80             |
| INNODB_IO_CAPACITY_MAX      | 4294967295    | 2000           |
| INNODB_LRU_FLUSH_SIZE       | 32            | 0              |
| HOST_CACHE_SIZE             | 128           | 279            |
| THREAD_CACHE_SIZE           | 256           | 151            |
| THREAD_POOL_SIZE            | 8             | 2              |
| INNODB_LOG_WRITE_AHEAD_SIZE | 512           | 4096           |
+-----------------------------+---------------+----------------+

```
{% endcode %}

If the server is running out of memory, the cause is often in this list.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Reduce the biggest consumers first.

Start with the variables that move total memory the most:

* [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_buffer_pool_size)
* [key\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md#key_buffer_size)
* [aria\_pagecache\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables.md#aria_pagecache_buffer_size)
* [query\_cache\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_cache_size)

Then review per-connection buffers, especially if concurrency is high:

* [join\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#join_buffer_size)
* [mrr\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#mrr_buffer_size)
* [sort\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#sort_buffer_size)
* [read\_buffer\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#read_buffer_size)
* [max\_heap\_table\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_heap_table_size)

Large per-connection buffers are safe only when few sessions use them at the same time.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Re-test under real concurrency.

After each change, recheck swapping, memory use, and query latency.

Avoid tuning many memory variables at once. Change the largest settings first, then re-measure.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## What Is the Key Buffer?

[MyISAM](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) does two different things for caching:

* Index blocks (1KB each, BTree structured, from `.MYI` file) live in the "key buffer".
* Data block caching (from .MYD file) is left to the OS, so be sure to leave a bunch of free space for this. Caveat: Some flavors of OS always claim to be using over 90%, even when there is really lots of free space.

To inspect the key buffer, run this statement:

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Key%';
```

The result is something like this:

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```
+------------------------+--------+
| Variable_name          | Value  |
+------------------------+--------+
| Key_blocks_not_flushed | 0      |
| Key_blocks_unused      | 107163 |
| Key_blocks_used        | 0      |
| Key_blocks_warm        | 0      |
| Key_read_requests      | 0      |
| Key_reads              | 0      |
| Key_write_requests     | 0      |
| Key_writes             | 0      |
+------------------------+--------+

```
{% endcode %}

Calculate [Key\_read\_requests](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-status-variables.md#key_read_requests) / [Key\_reads](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-status-variables.md#key_reads). If it is high (over 10), the key buffer is big enough, otherwise you should adjust the [key\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md#key_buffer_size) value.

## What Is the Buffer Pool?

InnoDB performs all its caching in the [buffer pool](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-buffer-pool.md), whose size is controlled by [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_buffer_pool_size). By default, it contains 128MiB of data and index blocks from the open tables (see [innodb\_page\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_page_size)), plus some maintenance overhead. Focus on total buffer pool size.

## Another Algorithm

Use this to set the main cache settings to the minimum. This can be important for systems with lots of other processes, and/or where RAM is 2GB or smaller.

Run [SHOW TABLE STATUS](../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-table-status.md) for all the tables in all the databases.

Add up index length for all MyISAM tables. Set [key\_buffer\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables.md#key_buffer_size) no larger than that size.

Add up `Data_length` + `Index_length` for all the InnoDB tables. Set [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_buffer_pool_size) to no more than 110% of that total.

If that leads to swapping, cut both settings back. Suggest cutting them down proportionately.

Run this to see the values for your system. (This query may run a while if you have a large set of tables.)

```sql
SELECT  ENGINE,
        ROUND(SUM(data_length) /1024/1024, 1) AS "Data MB",
        ROUND(SUM(index_length)/1024/1024, 1) AS "Index MB",
        ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length)/1024/1024, 1) AS "Total MB",
        COUNT(*) "Num Tables"
    FROM  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    WHERE  table_schema NOT IN (
             "information_schema", 
             "PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA", 
             "SYS_SCHEMA", 
             "ndbinfo")
    GROUP BY  ENGINE;
```

## Query Memory Allocation

There are two variables that dictate how memory is allocated while MariaDB parses and executes a query. [query\_prealloc\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_prealloc_size) defines the standard buffer for query execution, and [query\_alloc\_block\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_alloc_block_size) defines the size of extra memory blocks if `query_prealloc_size` is not large enough. Getting these variables right can reduce memory fragmentation in the server.

## Legacy and Specialized Scenarios

The sections below cover older platforms, specialized hardware, and edge cases. Use them only if they match your environment.

### Mutex Bottleneck

This is mostly a historical concern.

Older MySQL and MariaDB releases could hit mutex contention around a few shared structures:

* MyISAM's `key_buffer`
* The Query Cache
* InnoDB's `buffer_pool`

On current MariaDB releases, this is much less important than:

* sizing the buffer pool correctly
* avoiding unnecessary query cache usage
* fixing slow queries and bad indexes
* sizing connection concurrency realistically

### Legacy Platform Notes

These notes only apply to older or unusual deployments.

#### 32-Bit Operating Systems

On a 32-bit OS, MariaDB cannot effectively use large amounts of RAM.

* RAM above 4 GB is not usable by a 32-bit process.
* The operating system may impose a much lower per-process limit.
* Large cache settings can fail with out-of-memory errors even when the host still has free RAM.

Example: FreeBSD's `maxdsiz`, which defaults to 512MB.

```bash
$ ulimit -a
...
max memory size (kbytes, -m) 524288
```

If you must run MariaDB on a 32-bit platform, keep cache settings conservative.

If you get an error like `[ERROR] /usr/libexec/mysqld: Out of memory (Needed xxx bytes)`, it probably means that MariaDB exceeded what the OS is willing to give it. Decrease the cache settings.

#### 64-Bit OS with 32-Bit MariaDB

The OS can use more than 4 GB, but the MariaDB process still cannot.

If you are in this configuration, upgrade MariaDB to 64-bit if possible.

Until then, keep cache sizes below the effective 32-bit process limit.

#### 64-Bit OS and MariaDB

This is the standard deployment target these days.

Use the recommendations at the top of this page. They are more accurate than the old platform-specific rules of thumb.

To find the values of the [max\_connections](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_connections) and [thread\_stack](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#thread_stack) variable, issue this:

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```sql
SELECT @@max_connections, @@thread_stack;
```
{% endcode %}

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```
+-------------------+----------------+
| @@max_connections | @@thread_stack |
+-------------------+----------------+
|               151 |         299008 |
+-------------------+----------------+
```
{% endcode %}

Each thread takes some amount of RAM. This used to be about 200KB; 100 threads would be 20MB, not a significant size. If you have [max\_connections](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_connections) > 1000, you are talking about 200MB, maybe more. Having that many connections, though, likely implies other issues that should be addressed.

Thread pooling can change how concurrency behaves, but it does not remove the need to budget memory for peak active sessions.

Thread stack overruns are rare. If they occur, adjust `thread_stack` carefully and test.

### table\_open\_cache

The OS has some limit on the number of open files it will let a process have. Each table needs 1 to 3 open files. Each partition is effectively a table. Most operations on a partitioned table open _all_ partitions.

In Unix, ulimit tells you what the file limit is. The maximum value is in the tens of thousands, but sometimes it is set to only 1024. This limits you to about 300 tables. More discussion on ulimit

You can see how well your system is performing via [SHOW GLOBAL STATUS](../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-status.md); and computing the opens/second via [Opened\_files](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-status-variables.md#opened_files) / [Uptime](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-status-variables.md#uptime) If this is more than, say, 5, [table\_open\_cache](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#table_open_cache) should be increased. If it is less than, say, 1, you might get improvement by decreasing [table\_open\_cache](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#table_open_cache).

[table\_open\_cache](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#table_open_cache) defaults to `2000`.

### Query Cache

Set [query\_cache\_type](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_cache_type) to `OFF` and [query\_cache\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_cache_size) to `0` unless measurements show a clear benefit.

The [query cache](optimization-and-tuning/buffers-caches-and-threads/query-cache.md) can be very fast for repeated identical `SELECT` statements, but it has significant trade-offs:

* Every eligible `SELECT` must consult it.
* A write to a table invalidates cached results for that table.
* Contention around the shared cache can hurt concurrency.

If you decide to use it:

* Keep [query\_cache\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_cache_size) small, usually no more than `50M` .
* Prefer [query\_cache\_type](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#query_cache_type) = `DEMAND` .
* Use `SQL_CACHE` only on queries that benefit from reuse.

To see whether it helps, issue this statement:

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Qc%';
```

Review the result:

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```
+-------------------------+---------+
| Variable_name           | Value   |
+-------------------------+---------+
| Qcache_free_blocks      | 1       |
| Qcache_free_memory      | 1031248 |
| Qcache_hits             | 0       |
| Qcache_inserts          | 0       |
| Qcache_lowmem_prunes    | 0       |
| Qcache_not_cached       | 0       |
| Qcache_queries_in_cache | 0       |
| Qcache_total_blocks     | 1       |
+-------------------------+---------+
```
{% endcode %}

A rough read hit rate is:

* `Qcache_hits / Qcache_inserts`

If that ratio stays low, disable the query cache.

### thread\_cache\_size

The [thread\_cache\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#thread_cache_size) rarely needs manual tuning. Keep it small but non-zero unless you have evidence that connection creation is a bottleneck.

This setting controls how many disconnected threads are kept ready for reuse. It does not limit concurrent connections; [max\_connections](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_connections) does.

A very high value usually wastes memory without helping throughput.

### Binary Logs

If you enable [binary logging](../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) for replication or point-in-time recovery, logs will accumulate until they are purged.

Set a retention policy explicitly. On current MariaDB releases, prefer [binlog\_expire\_logs\_seconds](standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md#binlog_expire_logs_seconds). Older setups may still use [expire\_logs\_days](standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables.md#expire_logs_days).

Choose a retention period that matches your recovery and replication requirements.

### Swapping

Swapping usually hurts MariaDB badly.

For dedicated MariaDB hosts on Linux, a low `vm.swappiness` value often works best because it reduces the chance that large caches are pushed to disk under pressure.

In practice:

* Avoid heavy swapping.
* Leave enough free RAM for the operating system.
* Use a low `vm.swappiness` value if your platform and workload support it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not use this as a substitute for proper memory sizing.
{% endhint %}

### NUMA

NUMA[^3] can cause uneven memory allocation on multi-socket systems.

To see if your machine is a NUMA host, run this command (available on Linux):

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```bash
numactl --hardware
```
{% endcode %}

If the output yields `available: 1 nodes (0)`, all CPUs share memory equally. If it indicates 2 or mode nodes, the machine is a NUMA host.

If you see swapping or memory imbalance on a NUMA host, check the platform configuration before changing MariaDB settings. In some environments, interleaving memory allocation can avoid one NUMA node filling early while others stay underused.

Possible mitigations include:

* BIOS or firmware memory interleaving.
* OS-level NUMA configuration.
* Setting [innodb\_numa\_interleave](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_numa_interleave) where supported.

Only tune NUMA after you confirm it is part of the problem.

### Huge Pages

Huge pages can reduce page table overhead for large memory allocations.

For InnoDB-heavy systems with large buffer pools, explicit huge pages can help. Transparent huge pages are often less predictable and can hurt latency, so review your OS defaults and current MariaDB release behavior before changing anything.

If you use huge pages:

* Size them to match the intended buffer pool usage.
* Validate startup and allocation behavior.
* Measure latency and throughput after enabling them.

Do not enable huge pages blindly on small or memory-constrained systems.

### ENGINE=MEMORY

The [Memory Storage Engine](../server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md) is a little-used alternative to [MyISAM](../server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/) and [InnoDB](../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/). The data is not persistent, so it has limited uses. The size of a MEMORY table is limited to [max\_heap\_table\_size](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_heap_table_size), which defaults to 16MB. I mention it in case you have changed the value to something huge; this would be stealing from other possible uses of RAM.

### How to Set Variables

In your [configuration file](../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md) (for instance, `my.cnf`), set a variable like this (`variable_name = value`), in the `[mariadb]` section, then restart the server for the changes to take effect:

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```ini
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 5G
```
{% endcode %}

For better readability of large values, use `M` for million and `G` for billion (note that the multiplier is `1024`):

* **1M** (Megabyte) = 1024<sup>2</sup> (1048576 bytes).
* **1G** (Gigabyte) = 1024<sup>3</sup> (1073741824 bytes).

Most settings can also be changed on the live system, by running a query like this:

```sql
SET @@global.key_buffer_size = 77000000;
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting variables like that isn't persistent across server starts.

However, you can do both – set the variable with a `SET` statement (so that it becomes immediately available), and in the configuration file (so that it's persistent when the server is restarted).

Note that you cannot use `M` or `G` when setting variable values with a `SET` statement.
{% endhint %}

To see the setting of a global variable, run a statement like this:

```sql
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE "key_buffer_size";
+-----------------+----------+
| Variable_name   | Value    |
+-----------------+----------+
| key_buffer_size | 76996608 |
+-----------------+----------+
```

You may want to do both (SET and modify my.cnf) in order to make the change immediately and have it so that the next restart (for whatever reason) will again get the value.

### Application Connection Pools

Application servers and web servers can create far more database connections than MariaDB can use efficiently.

* Size the application pool explicitly.
* Keep [max\_connections](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_connections) high enough for real traffic, but not so high that worst-case per-connection buffers can exhaust RAM.
* Prefer connection pooling over one-connection-per-request patterns.

## Tools

* [MySQLTuner](https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl)
* [TUNING-PRIMER](https://github.com/BMDan/tuning-primer.sh)

These tools can help identify obvious configuration problems, but they often assume worst-case memory use.

One common warning looks like this:

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```
Maximum possible memory usage: 31.3G (266% of installed RAM)
```
{% endcode %}

Treat that as an upper bound, not a prediction. It usually assumes all [max\_connections](optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#max_connections) are active and all are using large per-query buffers at the same time.

Another warning can look like this:

{% code overflow="wrap" expandable="true" %}
```
Total fragmented tables: 23 
```
{% endcode %}

This implies that [OPTIMIZE TABLE](optimization-and-tuning/optimizing-tables/optimize-table.md) _might_ help. Use it for tables with either a high percentage of "free space" (see [SHOW TABLE STATUS](../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-table-status.md)) or where you know you run a lot of `DELETE` and/or `UPDATE` statements. Still, don't bother to optimze too often. Once a month should suffice.
