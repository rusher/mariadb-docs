# Federated MariaDB Enterprise Spider Topology Migrate Tables


# Overview


The Federated MariaDB Enterprise Spider topology can be used to migrate tables from one MariaDB Enterprise Server node to another MariaDB Enterprise Server node:


* The MariaDB Enterprise Server node with the source table is configured as a Data Node.
* The MariaDB Enterprise Server node with the destination table is configured as a Spider Node.
* The Data Table is the source table on the Data Node.
* A Spider Table is created on the Spider Node that references the Data Table on the Data Node.
* On the Spider node, the Data Table's data is migrated to the destination table by querying the Spider Table like the following:


```
INSERT INTO innodb_tab
   SELECT * FROM spider_tab;
```

Follow the steps below to migrate tables using the Federated MariaDB Enterprise Spider topology.


# Deploy the Federated Topology


Before you can migrate tables, the Federated MariaDB Enterprise Spider topology must be deployed.


For additional information, see "[Deploy MariaDB Enterprise Spider](../../README.md)".


# Create Local Tables


A local copy of the table must be created. This new table will contain the migrated data.


* On the Spider Node*, create a local copy of each table that is being migrated:


```
CREATE DATABASE hq_sales;

CREATE SEQUENCE hq_sales.invoice_seq;

CREATE TABLE hq_sales.invoices (
   branch_id INT NOT NULL DEFAULT (1) CHECK (branch_id=1),
   invoice_id INT NOT NULL DEFAULT (NEXT VALUE FOR migrated_hq_sales.invoice_seq),
   customer_id INT,
   invoice_date DATETIME(6),
   invoice_total DECIMAL(13, 2),
   payment_method ENUM('NONE', 'CASH', 'WIRE_TRANSFER', 'CREDIT_CARD', 'GIFT_CARD'),
   PRIMARY KEY(branch_id, invoice_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

# Migrate the Tables


The table data can be migrated to the local table using the Spider Tables.


* On the Spider Node*, migrate the table data to the local copy of the table using the [INSERT SELECT](../../../../../sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/insert.md) statement:


```
INSERT INTO hq_sales.invoices
   SELECT * FROM spider_hq_sales.invoices;
```

# Test Read Operations


On the Spider Node, read from the local copy of the table using a [SELECT](../../../../../sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/select.md) statement to confirm that the data has been migrated:


```
SELECT * FROM hq_sales.invoices;
```

```
