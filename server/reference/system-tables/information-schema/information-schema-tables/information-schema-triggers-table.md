# Information Schema TRIGGERS Table

The [Information Schema](../) `TRIGGERS` table contains information about [triggers](../../../../server-usage/triggers-events/triggers/).

It has the following columns:

Queries to the `TRIGGERS` table will return information only for databases and tables for which you have the `TRIGGER` [privilege](../../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#table-privileges). Similar information is returned by the [SHOW TRIGGERS](../../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-triggers.md) statement.
