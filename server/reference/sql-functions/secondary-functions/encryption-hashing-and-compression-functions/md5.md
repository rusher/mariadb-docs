# MD5

## Syntax

```bnf
MD5(str)
```

## Description

Calculates an MD5 128-bit checksum for the string.

The return value is a 32-hex digit string, and a nonbinary string in the connection [character set and collation](../../../data-types/string-data-types/character-sets/), determined by the values of the [character\_set\_connection](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#character_set_connection) and [collation\_connection](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#collation_connection) system variables.

`NULL` is returned if the argument was `NULL`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Don't use this function as an encryption function.**

MD5 can be used as a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption. Historically it was widely used as a cryptographic hash function; however it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.

See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) for details.
