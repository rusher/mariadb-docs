# TokuDB Status Variables

TokuDB has been deprecated by its upstream maintainer. It is disabled from [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-10-5-series/what-is-mariadb-105) and has been removed in [MariaDB 10.6](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106) - [MDEV-19780](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19780). We recommend [MyRocks](../myrocks/) as a long-term migration path.

This page documents status variables related to the [TokuDB storage engine](./). See [Server Status Variables](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-status-variables.md) for a complete list of status variables that can be viewed with [SHOW STATUS](../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-status.md).
