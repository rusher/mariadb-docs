# Virtual Machine to Test the Cassandra Storage Engine

{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/the-cassandra-storage-engin....md" %}

Julien Duponchelle has made a virtual machine available for testing the Cassandra storage engine. Find out more at [Cassandra MariaDB VirtualBox](https://julien.duponchelle.info/Cassandra-MariaDB-Virtual-Box.html).

The virtual machine is based on:

* Ubuntu 12.04
* DataStax Cassandra
* [MariaDB 5.5.27](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/5.5/5.5.27) + Cassandra

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is used for setup. Full [instructions](https://julien.duponchelle.info/Cassandra-MariaDB-Virtual-Box.html) are at Julien's website.
