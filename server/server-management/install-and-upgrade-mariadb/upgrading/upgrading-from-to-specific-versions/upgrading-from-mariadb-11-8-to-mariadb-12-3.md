# Upgrading from MariaDB 11.8 to MariaDB 12.3

This page includes details for upgrading from [MariaDB 11.8](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/11.8/what-is-mariadb-118), the previous long-term maintenance version, to [MariaDB 12.3](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/12.3/mariadb-12.3-changes-and-improvements).

### How to Upgrade

For Windows, see [Upgrading MariaDB on Windows](../upgrading-mariadb-on-windows.md).

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend [mariadb-backup](../../../../server-usage/backup-and-restore/mariadb-backup/mariadb-backup-overview.md).

The suggested upgrade procedure is:

1. Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs MariaDB 12.3.
   1. On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB APT repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#updating-the-mariadb-apt-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
   2. On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB YUM repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#updating-the-mariadb-yum-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
   3. On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB ZYpp repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#updating-the-mariadb-zypp-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
2. [Stop MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
3. Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.
   1. On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following: `sudo apt-get remove mariadb-server`
   2. On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following: `sudo yum remove MariaDB-server`
   3. On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following: `sudo zypper remove MariaDB-server`
4. Install the new version of MariaDB.
   1. On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with APT](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt) for more information.
   2. On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum) for more information.
   3. On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp) for more information.
5. Make any desired changes to configuration options in [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`. This includes removing any options that are no longer supported.
6. [Start MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
7. Run [mariadb-upgrade](../../../../clients-and-utilities/deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade.md), to:
   1. Ensure that the system tables in the [mysql](../../../../reference/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/) database are fully compatible with the new version.
   2. Perform a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB.

### Incompatible Changes Between 11.8 and 12.3

On most servers upgrading from 11.8 should be painless. However, there are some things that have changed which could affect an upgrade:

#### Options That Have Been Removed or Renamed

The following options should be removed or renamed if you use them in your [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md):

| Option                                                                                                                       | Reason                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [big\_tables](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md)            | Deprecated in MariaDB 10.5.0 and now removed. No longer needed, as the server handles large result sets automatically.                       |
| [storage\_engine](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md)        | Deprecated alias for `default_storage_engine` since MariaDB 5.5, and now removed. Use [default\_storage\_engine](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md) instead. |
| [large\_page\_size](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md)      | Read-only variable deprecated in MariaDB 10.5.3 and now removed.                                                                             |

#### Options That Have Changed Default Values

| Option                                                                                                                                   | Old default | New default |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [innodb\_snapshot\_isolation](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_snapshot_isolation)      | `OFF`       | `ON`        |

With [innodb\_snapshot\_isolation](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_snapshot_isolation) now enabled by default, InnoDB transactions under the Repeatable Read isolation level enforce snapshot isolation more strictly. A transaction that reads a table and then modifies data based on an outdated snapshot may now fail with [`ERROR 1020`](../../../../reference/error-codes/mariadb-error-codes-1000-to-1099/e1020.md) where it previously succeeded:

```sql
ERROR 1020 (HY000): Record has changed since last read in table 't'
```

After upgrading, applications that rely on Repeatable Read transactions may see additional `ERROR 1020` failures, particularly for bulk `DELETE` or `UPDATE` operations and workloads with concurrent changes. To restore the previous behavior, set `innodb_snapshot_isolation=OFF`. For more details, see [innodb\_snapshot\_isolation](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables.md#innodb_snapshot_isolation).

#### Changes in Replication Behavior

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you run [mariadb-upgrade](../../../../clients-and-utilities/deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade.md), the [`CHANGE MASTER TO ... master_use_gtid`](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/replication-statements/change-master-to.md) option is not currently carried over and is reset to `DEFAULT`. After upgrading a replica, check the replication configuration and re-apply `master_use_gtid` if you rely on it. Downgrading is not affected. See [MDEV-39788](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-39788).
{% endhint %}

#### Deprecated Options

The `MYSQLD_OPTS` environment variable for the systemd service is deprecated. Place configuration options directly into [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`, instead.
