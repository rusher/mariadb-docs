# Upgrade to MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.3

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

These instructions detail the **upgrade** from a previous version of **MariaDB Enterprise Server** to **MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.3** on a range of [supported Operating Systems](https://mariadb.com/engineering-policies/).

When [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise-server/) is upgraded, the old version needs to be uninstalled, and the new version needs to be installed.

See [What's New in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.3](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/whats-new-in-mariadb-enterprise-server-10-3/).

## Data Backup <a href="#data-backup" id="data-backup"></a>

Occasionally, issues can be encountered during upgrades. These issues can even potentially corrupt the database's data files, preventing you from easily reverting to the old installation. Therefore, it is generally best to perform a backup before upgrading. If an issue is encountered during the upgrade, you can use the backup to restore your MariaDB Server database to the old version. If the upgrade finishes without issue, then the backup can be deleted.

The instructions below show how to perform a backup using [MariaDB Backup](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariabackup/). For more information about backing up and restoring the database, please see the [Recovery Guide](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/backup-and-restore-with-mariadb-enterprise-server/).

1\. Take a full backup. On MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 and later:

```
$ sudo mariadb-backup --backup \
      --user=mariabackup_user \
      --password=mariabackup_passwd \
      --target-dir=/data/backup/preupgrade_backup
```

Confirm successful completion of the backup operation.

2\. The backup must be prepared. On the MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 and later:

```
$ sudo mariadb-backup --prepare \
      --target-dir=/data/backup/preupgrade_backup
```

Confirm successful completion of the prepare operation.

3\. Backups should be tested before they are trusted.

## Audit Plugin Considerations <a href="#audit-plugin-considerations" id="audit-plugin-considerations"></a>

If you have the [MariaDB Audit Plugin](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-audit-plugin/) installed and if you are upgrading to MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 or later, then the audit plugin should be removed prior to the upgrade to prevent conflict with the [MariaDB Enterprise Audit Plugin](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise-audit/) that is present in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 or later. It can be removed by using the [UNINSTALL SONAME](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/uninstall-soname/) statement:

```
UNINSTALL SONAME 'server_audit';
```

And if you load the plugin in a configuration file using the plugin\_load\_addoption, then the option should also be removed. The [MariaDB Enterprise Audit Plugin](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise-audit/) will automatically be installed after installing MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 or later.

## Uninstall the Old Version <a href="#uninstall-the-old-version" id="uninstall-the-old-version"></a>

When upgrading to a new major release of MariaDB Enterprise Server, it is necessary to remove the existing installation of MariaDB Enterprise Server before installing the new version of MariaDB Enterprise Server. Otherwise, the package manager will refuse to install the new version of MariaDB Enterprise Server.

### Stop the MariaDB Server Process <a href="#stop-the-mariadb-server-process" id="stop-the-mariadb-server-process"></a>

Before the old version can be uninstalled, we first need to stop the current MariaDB Server process.

1\. Set the [innodb\_fast\_shutdown](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables/#innodb_fast_shutdown) system variable to 1:

```
SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown = 1;
```

2\. Use [XA RECOVER](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/xa-transactions/#xa-recover) to confirm that there are no external [XA transactions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/xa-transactions/) in a prepared state:

```
XA RECOVER;
```

Commit or roll back any open [XA transactions](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/xa-transactions/) before stopping the node for upgrade.

3\. Stop the server process: For distributions that use `systemd` (most supported OSes), you can manage the server process using the `systemctl` command:

```
$ sudo systemctl stop mariadb
```

4\. Configure MariaDB. Installation only loads MariaDB Enterprise Server onto the system. MariaDB Enterprise Server requires configuration before the database server is ready for use.

## Configuration <a href="#configuration" id="configuration"></a>

For platforms that use YUM or ZYpp as a package manager: MariaDB Enterprise Server's packages bundle several configuration files:

* /etc/my.cnf
* /etc/my.cnf.d/client.cnf
* /etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-enterprise.cnf
* /etc/my.cnf.d/mysql-clients.cnf
* /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf

If your version of any of these configuration files contained any custom edits, then the package manager may save your edited version with the `.rpmsave` extension during the upgrade process. If you want to continue using your version with the custom edits, then you may need to move it back.

For example, to move `server.cnf` back in place:

```
$ sudo mv /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf.original
```

```
$ sudo mv /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf.rpmsave /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf
```

## Starting the Server <a href="#starting-the-server" id="starting-the-server"></a>

MariaDB Enterprise Server includes configuration to `start, stop, restart, enable/disable` on boot, and check the status of the Server using the operating system's default process management system.

For distributions that use `systemd`, you can manage the Server process using the `systemctl` command:

| Operation              | Command                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Start                  | sudo systemctl start mariadb   |
| Stop                   | sudo systemctl stop mariadb    |
| Restart                | sudo systemctl restart mariadb |
| Enable during startup  | sudo systemctl enable mariadb  |
| Disable during startup | sudo systemctl disable mariadb |
| Status                 | sudo systemctl status mariadb  |

## Upgrading the Data Directory <a href="#upgrading-the-data-directory" id="upgrading-the-data-directory"></a>

MariaDB Enterprise Server ships with a utility that can be used to identify and correct compatibility issues in the new version. After you upgrade your Server and start the server process, run this utility to upgrade the data directory.

The utility is called `mariadb-upgrade in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4 and later:`

```
$ sudo mariadb-upgrade
```

## Testing <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>

When MariaDB Enterprise Server is up and running on your system, you should test that it is working and there weren't any issues during startup.

1\. Connect to the server using MariaDB Client using the `root@localhost` user account. MariaDB Client is called `mariadb` (ES 10.4 and later):

```
$ sudo mariadb
```

```
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MariaDB connection id is 9
Server version: 11.4.5-3-MariaDB-Enterprise MariaDB Enterprise Server

Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MariaDB [(none)]>
```

2\. You can also verify the server version by checking the value of the [version](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#version) system variable with the [SHOW GLOBAL STATUS](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/show-status/) statement: SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'version';

```
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                       |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| version       | 11.4.5-3-MariaDB-Enterprise |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
```

3\. You can also verify the server version by calling the [VERSION()](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/version/) function:

```
SELECT VERSION();
+-----------------------------+
| VERSION()                   |
+-----------------------------+
| 11.4.5-3-MariaDB-Enterprise |
+-----------------------------+
```
