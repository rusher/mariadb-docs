# Mirror Sites for MariaDB

We rely on mirrors to distribute MariaDB to the world through the official
download site at [download](https://mariadb.org/download). If you would like to
volunteer to become a mirror, thank you! Getting you set up is easy.


The state of MariaDB mirrors is monitored at [](https://mirmon.mariadb.org/)


## How to Become a MariaDB Mirror


The only requirements for becoming a mirror are:


1. A willingness to mirror MariaDB
1. Mirroring is done using rsync
1. An https mirror should be utilised (http mirrors are not accepted any more)
1. Available bandwidth and disk space

  * Each release of MariaDB takes about between 110-140GB of disk space for all of the
 various packages we create. There are several MariaDB releases per year, but
 only the most recent two from each main MariaDB series (as of March 2025 this is 10.5, 10.6, 10.11, 11.2, 11.4, 11.7 and 11.8) are kept on the mirrors
  * We recommend our mirrors have at least a 100Mbit/sec connection to the
 Internet
1. The ability to do directory listings on mirrored sub-directories on your
 mirror host (for some platforms the
 [download](https://mariadb.org/download) page links directly to mirrored
 sub-directories)
1. The mirror should update itself, preferably every 6 hours, but at the very least, twice a day. (See
 [Updating Notes](mirror-sites-for-mariadb.md)
 for more information)


### Updating Notes


MariaDB will normally have no more than one release per
series (10.4, 10.5, etc...) per month. There may be times when this is not the
case (such as if a major bug is found), but those times are few.


Timing for release announcements is generally oriented to the U.S. Eastern time
zone. So if your mirror only updates less frequently than every 6 hours, have it update after
midnight, but before 06:00, U.S. Eastern Time.


With rsync, it is no problem to update several times per day, and doing so is
encouraged.


## rsync Information


The two primary rsync URLs for mirrors to use are:


USA:


```
rsync.osuosl.org::mariadb
```

Europe:


```
mirror.netcologne.de::mariadb
```

Here are suggested rsync commands for a mirror to use:


```
rsync -a --partial --delete-after --delay-updates mirror.netcologne.de::mariadb /path/to/local/download/directory/rsync_test
```

```
rsync -a --partial --delete-after --delay-updates rsync.osuosl.org::mariadb /path/to/local/download/directory/rsync_test
```

Be aware that when using the above rsync command, a "mariadb" directory **will
not** be created. Instead, the contents of the mariadb module will be rsynced
into whatever local folder you specify. We suggest creating a "mariadb" folder
for this.


It is also a good idea to test your rsync command before adding it to a cron
job by adding the `-v --dry-run` flags to the command temporarily so you can
see what it will do (without actually doing anything).


As of February 2024, running the above command will use around 900GB of disk
space in total.


See the
[rsync documentation](https://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html) for details
on what each of the arguments in the command above does.


### Secondary rsync mirrors


We also have several secondary rsync mirrors you can pull from. In many instances pulling from the secondary mirror is faster than pulling from the primary rsync mirrors. Here they are, with the country they are located in. Simply replace the rsync URI in the example above with one from this list to use it.

## Getting Added to the Mirror List


Once you have initially mirrored the MariaDB release tree, please send an email
to (mirror (at) mariadb [dot] org) with the following information:


1. The name of the company or organization sponsoring the mirror (so we can
 give credit where credit is due).
1. Contact name (and email address) for your mirror (so we know who to contact
 if there are any issues)
1. The general physical location (e.g. "Paris, France", "Hong Kong", or "Austin,
 Texas, USA") of the mirror (we use geolocation to try and send people to a
 mirror close to them).
1. The base public URL for the mirror
 (e.g. `'<code>http://mirror.example.net/pub/mariadb</code>'`).
1. The mirror you are using to rsync from


Once we receive your email and verify your mirror is working we'll add you to the list of mirrors. Apologies in advance in case of slow responses - mirror updates are usually batched around release time.


Thank you for volunteering to mirror MariaDB!

## The MariaDB Archive


The distributed mirrors above only hold the most recent 3-4 releases of each
MariaDB series (10.5, 10.4, etc...). If you need to access older MariaDB
releases, there is an archive server that contains every MariaDB release. This
server is available via the web at [archive.mariadb.org](https://archive.mariadb.org) and via rsync at:


```
archive.mariadb.org::mariadb
```

### Mirroring the MariaDB Archive with rsync


If you want to mirror the archive mirror, please contact us at mirror@mariadb.org in advance.


To mirror the archive with rsync, something like the following will get you everything:


```
rsync -avP archive.mariadb.org::mariadb/ /path/to/local/dir/
```

...or you can specify a specific release such as:


```
rsync -avP archive.mariadb.org::mariadb/mariadb-10.4.13/ /path/to/local/dir/
```

**Warning**, as of January 2023, the entire archive will use around 10 TB of disk space in
total, and if you want to keep your mirror up to date (via cron routine for instance), please **first compare** the STATUS file **before** doing the rsync. This file will be updated anytime a new content is added in the archive tree.


You can use something like the following:


```
rsync archive.mariadb.org::mariadb/STATUS /tmp/STATUS
diff -q /tmp/STATUS /path/to/local/dir/STATUS || rsync -avP archive.mariadb.org::mariadb/ /path/to/local/dir/
```

We reserve the right to block IPs that continually rsync the archive mirror when no new content was added, since it uselessly overloads the archive server, which uses a slow remote storage system.


To get a listing of the top level items in the archive including a list of every MariaDB release, just do:


```
rsync archive.mariadb.org::mariadb
```

If you would like to become a full archive mirror of MariaDB and be listed
here, just let us know via the [contact information above](#getting-added-to-the-mirror-list). Thanks!
