# mariadb-test Overview

## Basics

The client program `mariadb-test` executes a _test file_ and compares the produced output with the _result file_. If the files match, the test is passed; otherwise, the test has failed. This approach can be used to test any SQL statement, as well as other executables (with the `exec` command).

The complete process of testing is governed and monitored by the _mariadb-test-run.pl_ driver script, or _mtr_ for short (for convenience, `mtr` is created as a symbolic link to `mariadb-test-run.pl`). The `mtr` script is responsible for preparing the test environment, creating a list of all tests to run, running them, and producing the report at the end. It can run many tests in parallel, execute tests in an order which minimizes server restarts (as they are slow), run tests in a debugger or under `valgrind` or `strace`, and so on.

Test files are located in _suites_. A _suite_ is a directory which contains test files, result files, and optional configuration files. The `mtr` script looks for suites in the `mariadb-test/suite` directory, and in the `mariadb-test` subdirectories of plugins and storage engine directories. For example, the following are all valid suite paths:

```
mariadb-test/suite/rpl
```

```
mariadb-test/suite/handler
```

```
storage/example/mariadb-test/demo
```

```
plugin/auth_pam/mariadb-test/pam
```

In almost all cases, the suite directory name is the suite name. A notable historical exception is the _main_ suite, which is located directly in the`mariadb-test` directory.

Test files have a `.test` extension and can be placed directly in the suite directory (for example, `mariadb-test/suite/handler/interface.test`) or in the`t` subdirectory (e.g. `mariadb-test/suite/rpl/t/rpl_alter.test` or`mariadb-test/t/grant.test`). Similarly, result files have the `.result` extension and can be placed either in the suite directory or in the `r` subdirectory.

A test file can include other files (with the `source` command). These included files can have any name and may be placed anywhere, but customarily they have a `.inc` extension and are located either in the suite directory or in the `inc` or `include` subdirectories (for example, `mariadb-test/suite/handler/init.inc` or`mariadb-test/include/start_slave.inc`).

Other files which affect testing, while not being tests themselves, are:

* `disabled.def`
* `suite.opt`
* other `*.opt` files
* `my.cnf`
* other `*.cnf` files
* `combinations`
* other `*.combinations` files
* `suite.pm`
* `*.sh` files
* `*.require` files
* `*.rdiff` files
* `valgrind.supp`

See [Auxiliary files](mariadb-test-auxiliary-files.md) for details on these.

## Overlays

In addition to regular suite directories, `mtr` supports _overlays_. An _overlay_ is a directory with the same name as an existing suite, but which is located in a storage engine or plugin directory. For example,`storage/myisam/mariadb-test/rpl` could be a _myisam_ overlay of the _rpl_ suite in `mariadb-test/suite/rpl`. And`plugin/daemon_example/mariadb-test/demo` could be a _daemon\_example_ overlay of the _demo_ suite in `storage/example/mariadb-test/demo`. As a special exception, an overlay of the main suite, should be called `main`, as in `storage/pbxt/mariadb-test/main`.

An overlay is like a second transparent layer in a graphics editor. It can obscure, extend, or modify the background image. Also, one may notice that an overlay is very close to a _UnionFS_, but implemented in perl inside `mtr`.

An overlay can replace almost any file in the overlaid suite, or add new files. For example, if some overlay of the main suite contains a`include/have_innodb.inc` file, then all tests that include it will see and use the overlaid version. Or, an overlay can create a `t/create.opt` file\
(even though the main suite does not have such a file), and `create.test` is executed with the specified additional options.

But adding an overlay never affects how the original suite is executed. That is, `mtr` always executes the original suite as if no overlay was present. Additionally, it executes a combined "union" of the overlay and the original suite. When doing that, `mtr` takes care to avoid re-executing tests that are not changed in the overlay. For example, creating `t/create.opt` in\
the overlay of the main suite will only cause `create.test` to be executed in the overlay. But creating `suite.opt` affects all tests — and it will cause all tests to be re-executed with\
the new options.

## Combinations

In certain cases it makes sense to run a specific test or a group of tests several times with different server settings. This can be done using so-called _combinations_. Combinations are groups of settings that are used alternatively. A combinations file defines these alternatives using `my.cnf` syntax, for example:

```ini
[row]
binlog-format=row
[stmt]
binlog-format=statement
[mix]
binlog-format=mixed
```

All tests where this combinations file applies is run three times: Once for the combination called "row", and `--binlog-format=row` on the server command line, once for the "stmt" combination, and once for the "mix" combination.

More than one combinations file may be applicable to a given test file. In this case, `mtr` runs the test for all possible combinations of the given combinations. A test that uses replication (three combinations as above) and InnoDB (two combinations - innodb and xtradb), is run six times.

## Sample Output

The typical `mtr` output looks like this:

```
==============================================================================
TEST                                  WORKER RESULT   TIME (ms) or COMMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
rpl.rpl_row_find_row_debug                [ skipped ]  Requires debug build
main-pbxt.connect                         [ skipped ]  No PBXT engine
main-pbxt.mysqlbinlog_row                 [ disabled ]  test expects a non-transactional engine
rpl.rpl_savepoint 'mix,xtradb'            w2 [ pass ]    238
rpl.rpl_stm_innodb 'innodb_plugin,row'    w1 [ skipped ]  Neither MIXED nor STATEMENT binlog format
binlog.binlog_sf 'stmt'                   w2 [ pass ]      7
unit.dbug                                 w2 [ pass ]      1
maria.small_blocksize                     w1 [ pass ]     23
sys_vars.autocommit_func3 'innodb_plugin' w1 [ pass ]      5
sys_vars.autocommit_func3 'xtradb'        w1 [ pass ]      6
main.ipv6                                 w1 [ pass ]    131
...
```

Every test is printed as "suitename.testname", and a suite name may include an overlay name (like in `main-pbxt`). After the test name, `mtr` prints combinations that were applied to this test, if any.

A similar syntax can be used on the `mtr` command line to specify what tests to run:

| $ ./mtr innodb                  | $ ./mtr main.innodb                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $ ./mtr innodb                  | search for innodb test in every suite from the default list, and run all that was found.                      |
| $ ./mtr main.innodb             | run the innodb test from the main suite                                                                       |
| $ ./mtr main-pbxt.innodb        | run the innodb test from the pbxt overlay of the main suite                                                   |
| $ ./mtr main-.innodb            | run the innodb test from the main suite and all its overlays.                                                 |
| $ ./mtr main.innodb,xtradb      | run the innodb test from the main suite, only in the xtradb combination                                       |
| $ ./mtr --suite=rpl             | Run all test in the rpl suite (found in the suite/rpl directory)                                              |
| $ ./mtr --suite=mroonga/storage | Run all test in the mroonga/wrapper suite (found in the storage/mroonga/mysql-test/mroonga/storage directory) |

## Plugin Support

The `mtr` driver has special support for MariaDB plugins.

First, on startup it copies or symlinks all dynamically-built plugins into`var/plugins`. This allows one to have many plugins loaded at the same time. For example, you can load Federated and InnoDB engines together. Also, `mtr` creates environment variables for every plugin with the corresponding plugin name. For example, if the InnoDB engine was built, `$HA_INNODB_SO` is set to `ha_innodb.so` (or `ha_innodb.dll` on Windows). The test can\
safely use the corresponding environment variable on all platforms to refer to a plugin file; it  always has the correct platform-dependent extension.

Second, when combining server command line options (which may come from many\
different sources) into one long list before starting `mariadbd`, mtr treats`--plugin-load` specially. Normal server semantics is to use the latest value of any particular option on the command line. If one starts the server with, for example, `--port=2000 --port=3000`, the server will use the last value for the port, that is 3000. To allow different `.opt` files to require\
different plugins, mtr goes through the assembled server command line, and joins all `--plugin-load` options into one. Additionally it removes all empty`--plugin-load` options. For example, suppose a test is affected by three`.opt` files which contain, respectively:

```
--plugin-load=$HA_INNODB_SO
```

```
--plugin-load=$AUTH_PAM_SO
```

```
--plugin-load=$HA_EXAMPLE_SO
```

Assuming the Example engine was not built (`$HA_EXAMPLE_SO` is empty), the server gets this:

```
--plugin-load=ha_innodb.so:auth_pam.so
```

Instead of this:

```
--plugin-load=ha_innodb.so --plugin-load=auth_pam.so --plugin-load=
```

Third, to allow plugin sources to be simply copied into the `plugin/` or`storage/` directories, and still not affect existing tests (even if new plugins are statically linked into the server), mtr automatically disables all optional plugins on server startup. A plugin is optional if it can be disabled with the corresponding `--skip-XXX` server command line option. Mandatory plugins, like MyISAM or MEMORY, do not have `--skip-XXX` options (for instance, there is no `--skip-myisam` option). This `mtr` behavior means that no plugin, statically or dynamically built, has any effect on the server unless it was explicitly enabled. A convenient way to enable a given plugin _XXX_ for specific tests is to create a `have_XXX.opt` file which contains the\
necessary command line options, and a `have_XXX.inc` file which checks whether a plugin was loaded. Then any test that needs this plugin can source the `have_XXX.inc` file and have the plugin loaded automatically.

## mtr Communication Procedure

`mtr` is first creating the server socket (`master`). After that, `workers` are created using `fork()`.

For each worker, the `run_worker()` function is called, which is executing the following:

* Creates a new socket to connect to `server_port` obtained from the `master` .
* Initiate communication with the `master` using `START` command.
* `master` sends first test from list of tests supplied by the user and immediately sends command `TESTCASE` to the `worker` .
* `worker` gets command `TESTCASE` and processes test case, by calling `run_testcase()` function which starts(/restarts if needed) the server and sends `TESTRESULT` (in case of restart `WARNINGS` command is issued to the `master` in case some warnings/error logs are found).
* `master` accepts `TESTRESULT` command and run `mtr_report_test()` function which check does the test fail and also generates the new command `TESTCASE` if some new test case exist.
* If there is no other test case `master` sends `BYE` command which gets accepted by the `worker` which is properly closing the connection.

## Options

From MariaDB Server 11.8.3, you can start `mtr` with the `--enable_serveroutput` option to enable `DBMS_OUTPUT` messages. Disable displaying those messages with `--disable_serveroutput`. See [this page](../../../server-usage/stored-routines/dbms_output.md) for details.

A new package procedure was added, `DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINES_RESULT()`. It re-uses the SQL code fetching lines from the `DBMS_OUTPUT` buffer. All buffer lines are returned in a single result set. This procedure is MariaDB-specific; it does not exist in Oracle. This workaround is needed in MariaDB, instead of using the `GET_LINES()` function, because MariaDB does not support fetching arrays in the client-server protocol.
