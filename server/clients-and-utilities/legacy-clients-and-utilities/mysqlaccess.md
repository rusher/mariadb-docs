# mysqlaccess

`mysqlaccess` is a tool for checking access privileges, developed by Yves Carlier.

From [MariaDB 10.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/10.5/what-is-mariadb-105), the client is called `mariadb-access`. It can still be accessed under its original `mysqlaccess` name via a symlink in Linux, or an alternate binary in Windows.

See [mariadb-access](../administrative-tools/mariadb-access.md) for details.
