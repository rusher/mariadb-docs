# Getting Help With MariaDB

If you can't find help in the [MariaDB documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/gmXC0YXB3rRhXvpg5mb1/), you can also subscribe to the [mailing lists](../../joining-the-community.md#mailing-lists) or on [Zulip](https://mariadb.zulipchat.com) to communicate with MariaDB users and developers.

There's an active help community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for programming with SQL and indexing questions, and [DBA StackExchange](https://dba.stackexchange.com/) for non-programming questions for example tuning/backups/architecture/migration/replication etc. Use the _mariadb_ tag so questions are searchable by those that can help you.

You can report and check on bugs which apply to MariaDB in [JIRA](https://jira.mariadb.org/projects/MDEV/summary).

[MariaDB plc](https://mariadb.com) offers [commercial support](https://mariadb.com/services/mariadb-mysql-subscription-services).
