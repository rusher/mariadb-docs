# Upgrading from MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6 to 11.8 with Galera Cluster

[Galera Cluster](../../) ships with MariaDB Enterprise Server. Upgrading a Galera Cluster node is very similar to upgrading a standalone server directly from MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6 to 11.8. For the full list of prerequisites, removed and renamed options, character-set and optimizer-cost-model changes, and the reverse-replication safety net, follow the standalone guide:

This page covers only what is **specific to a Galera Cluster deployment**: choosing an upgrade method, the Galera provider package, cluster shutdown order, and bootstrapping.

{% hint style="info" %}
The direct upgrade from 10.6 to 11.8, skipping 11.4, is a supported Enterprise Server upgrade path - see the standalone guide linked above. This page applies that same jump to a Galera Cluster.
{% endhint %}

## Choosing an Upgrade Method

There are two ways to move a Galera Cluster from 10.6 to 11.8. Which one you choose depends on whether you can tolerate a maintenance window.

* **Full cluster shutdown (recommended for the direct 10.6-to-11.8 jump).** Stop every node, upgrade all nodes to 11.8, then bootstrap the cluster again. Because no 10.6 and 11.8 nodes are ever running at the same time, there is no mixed-version window to reason about - each node performs exactly the standalone 10.6-to-11.8 upgrade. This method requires a maintenance window.
* **Rolling upgrade through the intermediate LTS release (for zero downtime).** Galera guarantees mixed-version replication only between *adjacent* releases, so a no-downtime rolling upgrade goes through the intermediate Enterprise Server LTS release rather than jumping straight to 11.8: **10.6 → 11.4 → 11.8**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Confirm the rolling-upgrade path with MariaDB Support before you begin. For a **rolling** upgrade, never keep nodes on non-adjacent releases live at the same time (for example, some on 10.6 while others are already on 11.8): Galera negotiates the highest protocol version common to all members, and mixed-version replication is only validated between adjacent releases. To make the direct 10.6-to-11.8 jump, use the full-cluster-shutdown method so that no two major versions are ever live at once.
{% endhint %}

The rest of this page describes the **full-cluster-shutdown** method.

## Before You Begin

* **Read the standalone upgrade guide.** All of the 10.6-to-11.8 configuration work - removed options that abort startup (`wsrep_strict_ddl`, `wsrep_load_data_splitting`, `wsrep_replicate_myisam`, and others), the character-set and optimizer-cost-model changes, and `old_mode`/`character_set_collations` compatibility - applies to every node. See [Upgrading from MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6 to 11.8](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/upgrading/upgrade-paths/mariadb-enterprise-server-11.8/upgrading-from-mariadb-enterprise-server-10.6-to-11.8).
* **Take a backup.** Back up your data with [mariadb-backup](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/backup-and-restore/mariadb-backup/mariadb-backup-overview) before proceeding.
* **Identify the most advanced node.** Note which node has the highest `wsrep_last_committed` value at shutdown; you will bootstrap the new cluster from that node so it becomes the reference copy for state transfers.
* **Size gcache appropriately.** A large enough [`gcache.size`](../../reference/wsrep-variable-details/wsrep_provider_options.md#gcachesize) lets rejoining nodes catch up with an Incremental State Transfer (IST) instead of a full [State Snapshot Transfer (SST)](../../high-availability/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/introduction-to-state-snapshot-transfers-ssts.md). With a full shutdown, expect at least the first joining nodes to require an SST.
* **Finalize XA transactions.** Run `XA RECOVER` and commit or roll back any prepared external XA transactions before stopping the service.

## Performing a Full Cluster Shutdown Upgrade

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Take a final backup and stop the whole cluster**

Stop the application traffic (or drain the cluster from your load balancer or MaxScale), then perform a controlled shutdown on **every** node:

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown = 1;
```

```bash
sudo systemctl stop mariadb
```

Stop the node holding the most up-to-date data **last** so it is the final writer, and record it - you will bootstrap from it in step 6.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Remove the 10.6 Enterprise packages on each node**

Remove the old server together with the `galera-enterprise-4` wsrep provider to avoid package-manager conflicts.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="RHEL, CentOS, Alma, Rocky" %}
```bash
sudo yum remove "MariaDB-*" galera-enterprise-4
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Debian, Ubuntu" %}
```bash
sudo apt-get remove "mariadb-*" galera-enterprise-4
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="SLES" %}
```bash
sudo zypper remove "MariaDB-*" galera-enterprise-4
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Switch each node to the 11.8 Enterprise repositories**

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
curl -LsSO https://dlm.mariadb.com/enterprise-release-helpers/mariadb_es_repo_setup
chmod +x mariadb_es_repo_setup
sudo ./mariadb_es_repo_setup --token="CUSTOMER_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN" --apply --mariadb-server-version="11.8"
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Install the 11.8 release series on each node**

Installing `MariaDB-server` pulls in the matching `galera-enterprise-4` wsrep provider automatically - in the 11.8 series Galera is still a dependency of the server package. (This changes in MariaDB 12.3, where Galera moves to a separate `mariadb-server-galera` package.)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="RHEL, CentOS, Alma, Rocky" %}
```bash
sudo yum install MariaDB-server MariaDB-backup
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Debian, Ubuntu" %}
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-backup
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="SLES" %}
```bash
sudo zypper install MariaDB-server MariaDB-backup
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Apply the 11.8 configuration changes on each node**

Before starting the service, update `my.cnf` on every node: scrub the removed 10.6 options and adopt the 11.8 defaults exactly as described in the standalone guide's [Implement Version-Specific Configuration Changes](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/upgrading/upgrade-paths/mariadb-enterprise-server-11.8/upgrading-from-mariadb-enterprise-server-10.6-to-11.8) and [Incompatible and Significant Changes](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/upgrading/upgrade-paths/mariadb-enterprise-server-11.8/upgrading-from-mariadb-enterprise-server-10.6-to-11.8) sections. Leave the Galera settings in your `wsrep.cnf` (such as `wsrep_cluster_address` and `wsrep_provider_options`) unchanged unless a value is explicitly removed in 11.8.

{% hint style="warning" %}
On Galera nodes, do **not** set `new_mode = OFF`. `new_mode` is a `SET` variable and rejects a literal `OFF`; the invalid value aborts startup during wsrep recovery:

```
[ERROR] mariadbd: Error while setting value 'OFF' to 'new_mode'
```

To clear `new_mode` - for example, to keep query planning closer to 10.6 - use an empty value instead: `new_mode = ""`.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Bootstrap the first node**

Start the most up-to-date node (identified in step 1) as the first member of the new cluster, using [`--wsrep-new-cluster`](../installation-and-deployment/getting-started-with-mariadb-galera-cluster.md#bootstrapping-a-new-cluster) (for example, `galera_new_cluster`). This node becomes the reference copy the other nodes synchronize from.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Start the remaining nodes**

Start MariaDB normally on the other nodes, one at a time:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

Each node rejoins the cluster and synchronizes via IST or SST. Wait for a node to reach `Synced` before starting the next one.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Run the data upgrade on each node**

On every node, run [mariadb-upgrade](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/clients-and-utilities/deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade) with `--skip-write-binlog` so the schema-fix statements are not replicated across the cluster:

```bash
sudo mariadb-upgrade --skip-write-binlog
```

This upgrades the system tables and marks all tables as compatible with 11.8.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Post-Upgrade Verification

After all nodes are upgraded, confirm the cluster is healthy and running 11.8:

```sql
SELECT VERSION();
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS WHERE Variable_name IN
  ('wsrep_cluster_size', 'wsrep_cluster_status', 'wsrep_local_state_comment', 'wsrep_provider_version');
```

* `VERSION()` reflects the 11.8 series on every node.
* `wsrep_cluster_size` equals the number of nodes in the cluster.
* `wsrep_cluster_status` is `Primary` and `wsrep_local_state_comment` is `Synced`.
* [`wsrep_provider_version`](../../reference/galera-cluster-status-variables.md#wsrep_provider_version) is consistent across all nodes.

For general cluster health and quorum checks, see [What is MariaDB Galera Cluster](../../readme/mariadb-galera-cluster-guide.md).
