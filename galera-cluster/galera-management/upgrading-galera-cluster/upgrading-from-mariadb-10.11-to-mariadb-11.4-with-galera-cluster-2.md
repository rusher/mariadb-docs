# Upgrading from MariaDB 11.8 to MariaDB 12.3 with Galera Cluster

[Galera Cluster](../../) ships with the MariaDB Server. Upgrading a Galera Cluster node is very similar to upgrading a server from [MariaDB 11.8](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/11.8/what-is-mariadb-118) to [MariaDB 12.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/12.3/mariadb-12.3-changes-and-improvements). For more information on that process as well as incompatibilities between versions, see the [Upgrade Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/upgrading/mariadb-community-server-upgrade-paths).&#x20;

## Performing a Rolling Upgrade

The following steps can be used to perform a rolling upgrade from MariaDB 10.11 to MariaDB 11.4 when using Galera Cluster. In a rolling upgrade, each node is upgraded individually, so the cluster is always operational. There is no downtime from the application's perspective.&#x20;

First, before you get started:&#x20;

1. First, take a look at Upgrading from MariaDB 11.8 to MariaDB 12.3 to see what has changed between the major versions.&#x20;
2. CRITICAL - Package Architecture Changes: The Galera package dependency has been removed from standard server packages, and the Galera package is no longer included in the MariaDB repositories. A new `mariadb-server-galera` package now exists for Debian and RPM packages. You must explicitly install `mariadb-server-galera`. If you only upgrade the standard `mariadb-server` package, your systemd service definitions will not be Galera-capable for bootstrap or SST transfers.
3. Verify Configuration Files: Check whether any system variables or options have been changed or removed. For example, the use of `MYSQLD_OPTS` as an environment variable for systemd services is deprecated in 12.3. You should place configuration options directly into configuration files.
4. Assess Replication: Check whether replication behavior has changed in the new version.
5. Defer New Features: Do not use newly introduced features until all cluster nodes have been successfully upgraded to the new MariaDB version.
6. Ensure Compatibility: Verify your Galera provider version compatibility. Make sure you are prepared to manually supply `galera-4` if relying on RPMs.
7. Tune Gcache Size: You want to have a large enough `gcache` to avoid a [State Snapshot Transfer (SST)](../../high-availability/state-snapshot-transfers-ssts-in-galera-cluster/) during the rolling upgrade. Ensure your `wsrep_provider_options="gcache.size=2G"` is adequately sized.
8. Take a Backup: It is always recommended to take a reliable backup of your database using a tool like [mariadb-backup](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/backup-and-restore/mariadb-backup/mariadb-backup-overview) before proceeding.

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend mariadb-backup.&#x20;

Then, for each node, perform the following steps:

Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs [MariaDB 12.3](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/12.3/mariadb-12.3-changes-and-improvements).

Make any desired changes to configuration [options](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files) in option files, such as `my.cnf`. This includes removing any system variables or options that are no longer supported.

On Linux distributions that use systemd you may need to increase the service startup timeout as the default timeout of ninety seconds may not be sufficient. See [Systemd: Configuring the Systemd Service Timeout](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/systemd) for more information.

[Start MariaDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb).

Run [mysql\_upgrade](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/clients-and-utilities/legacy-clients-and-utilities/mysql_upgrade) (or [mariadb-upgrade](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/clients-and-utilities/deployment-tools/mariadb-upgrade)) with the `--skip-write-binlog` option. `mysql_upgrade` does two things:&#x20;

1. Ensures that the system tables in the mysql database are fully compatible with the new version.&#x20;
2. Does a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

When this process is done for one node, move onto the next node.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When upgrading the Galera wsrep provider, sometimes the Galera protocol version can change. The Galera wsrep provider should not start using the new protocol version until all cluster nodes have been upgraded to the new version, so this is not generally an issue during a rolling upgrade. However, this can cause issues if you restart a non-upgraded node in a cluster where the rest of the nodes have been upgraded.
