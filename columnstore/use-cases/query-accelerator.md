# Query Accelerator

{% hint style="warning" %}
MariaDB Query Accelerator is an **Alpha release**. Do not use it in production environments.\
Query Accelerator works only in **ColumnStore 25.10.0** and with **MariaDB Enterprise Server**.
{% endhint %}

## What is Query Accelerator

Query Accelerator is a feature that allows MariaDB to use ColumnStore to execute queries that are otherwise executed by InnoDB. Under the hood Columnstore:

* receives a query
* searches for applicable Engine Independent statistics for InnoDB table index column
* applies RBO rule to transform its InnoDB tables into a number of UNIONs over non-overlapping ranges of a suitable InnoDB table index
* retrieves the data in parallel from MariaDB and runs it using Columnstore runtime

## How to Enable Query Accelerator

* One has to set `columnstore_innodb_queries_use_mcs = on` in MariaDB configuration file and restart MariaDB server(my.cnf).
* Set a number of parameters in a client session:

```sql
set columnstore_unstable_optimizer=on;
set optimizer_switch="index_merge=off,index_merge_union=off,index_merge_sort_union=off,index_merge_intersection=off,index_merge_sort_intersection=off,index_condition_pushdown=off,derived_merge=off,derived_with_keys=off,firstmatch=off,loosescan=off,materialization=on,in_to_exists=off,semijoin=off,partial_match_rowid_merge=off,partial_match_table_scan=off,subquery_cache=off,mrr=off,mrr_cost_based=off,mrr_sort_keys=off,outer_join_with_cache=off,semijoin_with_cache=off,join_cache_incremental=off,join_cache_hashed=off,join_cache_bka=off,optimize_join_buffer_size=off,table_elimination=off,extended_keys=off,exists_to_in=off,orderby_uses_equalities=off,condition_pushdown_for_derived=on,split_materialized=off,condition_pushdown_for_subquery=off,rowid_filter=off,condition_pushdown_from_having=on,not_null_range_scan=off,hash_join_cardinality=off,cset_narrowing=off,sargable_casefold=off";
```

## Enable ColumnStore Processing for InnoDB Tables

There must be Engine Independent statistics for InnoDB table index column to be used for Query Accelerator.

```sql
analyze table <table_name> persistent for columns (<column_name>) indexes();
```

## Control Client Session Variables and Parameters

* `columnstore_unstable_optimizer`: enables unstable optimizer that is required for Query Accelerator RBO rule
* `columnstore_select_handler`: enables/disables ColumnStore processing for InnoDB tables
* `columnstore_query_accel_parallel_factor`: controls the number of parallel ranges to be used for Query Accelerator

Watch out `max_connections`. If you set `columnstore_query_accel_parallel_factor` to a high value, you may need to increase `max_connections` to avoid connection pool exhaustion.

## How to Verify Query Accelerator is Being Used

There are two ways to verify Query Accelerator is being used:

1. Use `select mcs_get_plan('rules')` to get a list of the rules that were applied to the query.
2. Look for patterns like `derived table - $added_sub_#db_name_#table_name_X` in the optimized plan using `select mcs_get_plan('optimized')`.
