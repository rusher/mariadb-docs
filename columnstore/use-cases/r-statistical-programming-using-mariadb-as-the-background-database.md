## Introduction to R

`R` is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.\
`R` provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …), graphical techniques, machine learning packages and is highly extensible.

One of `R’s` strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.

## The R Environment

`R` is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical display.&#x20;

It includes:

• an effective data handling and storage facility,

• a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,

• a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,

• graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and

• a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

## Using R with MariaDB

### R Installation

Some basic notions / tips on how to use R along with MariaDB are the following:

A. The recommended R distribution is “Base R”: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

B. The recommended R GUIs are RStudio Desktop, or RStudio Server: [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

Alternative GUIs would be:

* RCode (PGM Solutions): [RCode](https://www.pgm-solutions.com/rcode).

“R” and “MariaDB Server” can be installed either in the same server, or in different servers, as an ODBC communication protocol will be used for the exchange of data between the two environments.

### Data Transfer between R and MariaDB

#### Package: "odbc"

For the transfer of data between MariaDB Server and R Environment, it is recommended R's "odbc" Package: [CRAN odbc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/odbc/index.html)

* “odbc" is a new R package available on CRAN (Since 2017-02-05), and maintained by RStudio, which is designed to comply with the DBI specification.
* Tutorials on how to use R's "odbc" package can be found here:
  * Setting up ODBC Drivers: [DB RStudio Drivers](https://db.rstudio.com/drivers/)
  * "odbc" R Package: [DB RStudio odbc Usage](https://db.rstudio.com/odbc/#usage)

The "odbc" package requires to have previously installed the MariaDB or MySQL ODBC connector:

* [MariaDB ODBC Connector](https://downloads.mariadb.org/connector-odbc/)
* [MySQL ODBC Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/5.3.html)

For installing the "odbc" package from CRAN, execute in R:

```sql
install.packages("odbc")
```

#### Package: "RMariaDB"

“RMariaDB” R library, is a modern 'MariaDB' client based on 'Rcpp'.

For installing RMariaDB package through CRAN, execute the following R statement:

```sql
install.packages("RMariaDB")
```

And for connecting to MariaDB:

```sql
library(RMariaDB)

con <- dbConnect(
  drv = RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
  username = NULL,
  password = NULL, 
  host = NULL, 
  port = 3306
)
```

#### Other Packages: "readr", "RODBC"

There are other alternatives for data transfer between R and MariaDB:

* “readr” R package, for writing / reading CSV files. To be used in MariaDB along with “LOAD DATA INFILE”.
* "RODBC" R package: Robust and well-tested (Since 2000-05-24) package which enables data transfer between R and MariaDB by means of an ODBC connector: [CRAN RODBC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html)
  * It is slightly slower than RStudio's new "odbc" package (See benchmarks): [RStudio odbc](https://db.rstudio.com/odbc/)
  * For bug report to the RODBC package maintainer, use the following R statement: bug.report(package = "RODBC")
  * A vignette on how to use the RODBC package can be found here: [RODBC CRAN Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/vignettes/RODBC.pdf)

#### E) Statistical / Unsupervised Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence

**H2O.AI**

The R Programming language has support for the H2O.ai library ([h2o](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/h2o/index.html)), which enables to create in-memory multi-cluster GPU powered machine learning models.

For installing H2O.ai through CRAN, execute:

```sql
install.packages("h2o")
```

* [H2O.ai: Webpage](https://www.h2o.ai/)
* [H2O.ai Algorithms: Cheatsheet](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials/raw/master/training/h2o_algos/h2o_algos_cheat_sheet_04_25_17.pdf)

* [Deep Learning with H2O: Vignette](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/booklets/DeepLearningBooklet.pdf)

The following R Statements can be used for importing a MariaDB table to H2O.ai using the R Front End:

* import\_sql\_table: "This function imports a SQL table to H2OFrame in memory".
* import\_sql\_select: "This function imports the SQL table that is the result of the specified SQL query to H2OFrame in memory".

```sql
connection_url <- "jdbc:mariadb://172.16.2.178:3306/ingestSQL?&useSSL=false"
username <- "root"
password <- "abc123"

# Whole Table:
table <- "citibike20k"
my_citibike_data <- h2o.import_sql_table(connection_url, table, username, password)

# SELECT Query:
select_query <-  "SELECT  bikeid  FROM citibike20k"
my_citibike_data <- h2o.import_sql_select(connection_url, select_query, username, password)
```

NOTE: Be sure to start the h2o.jar in the terminal with your downloaded JDBC driver in the classpath:

```sql
java -cp <path_to_h2o_jar>:<path_to_jdbc_driver_jar> water.H2OApp
```

**KERAS**

[R package keras](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keras/index.html) offers an interface to [Python's 'Keras'](https://keras.io), a high-level neural networks 'API'.

'Keras' was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation, supports both convolution based networks and recurrent networks (as well as combinations of the two), and runs seamlessly on both 'CPU' and 'GPU' devices.
