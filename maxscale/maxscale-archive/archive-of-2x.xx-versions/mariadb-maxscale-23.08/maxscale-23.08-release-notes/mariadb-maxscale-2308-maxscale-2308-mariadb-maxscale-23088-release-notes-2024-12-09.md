## Known Issues and Limitations


In the previous version of MaxScale, maxctrl was implemented as a JavaScript
script that was run using the node interpreter on the platform. That introduced
a dependency on node that earlier was not present. In this version of MaxScale,
maxctrl is again a native executable without that dependency.


There are some limitations and known issues within this version of MaxScale.
For more information, please refer to the [Limitations](../mariadb-maxscale-23-08-about/mariadb-maxscale-2308-limitations-and-known-issues-within-mariadb-maxscale.md) document.
