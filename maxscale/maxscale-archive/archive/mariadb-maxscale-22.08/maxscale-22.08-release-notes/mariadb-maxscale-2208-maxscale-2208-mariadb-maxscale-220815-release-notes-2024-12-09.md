### Known Issues and Limitations

In the previous version of MaxScale, maxctrl was implemented as a JavaScript\
script that was run using the node interpreter on the platform. That introduced\
a dependency on node that earlier was not present. In this version of MaxScale,\
maxctrl is again a native executable without that dependency.

There are some limitations and known issues within this version of MaxScale.\
For more information, please refer to the [Limitations](../mariadb-maxscale-2208-about/mariadb-maxscale-2208-limitations-and-known-issues-within-mariadb-maxscale.md) document.
