# About MariaDB MaxScale 2.1

**MariaDB MaxScale** is a database proxy that forwards database statements to\
one or more database servers.

The forwarding is performed using rules based on the semantic understanding of\
the database statements and on the roles of the servers within the backend\
cluster of databases.

MariaDB MaxScale is designed to provide, transparently to applications, load\
balancing and high availability functionality. MariaDB MaxScale has a scalable\
and flexible architecture, with plugin components to support different protocols\
and routing approaches.

MariaDB MaxScale makes extensive use of the asynchronous I/O capabilities of the\
Linux operating system, combined with a fixed number of worker threads. _epoll_\
is used to provide the event driven framework for the input and output via\
sockets.

Many of the services provided by MariaDB MaxScale are implemented as external\
shared object modules loaded at runtime. These modules support a fixed\
interface, communicating the entry points via a structure consisting of a set of\
function pointers. This structure is called the "module object". Additional\
modules can be created to work with MariaDB MaxScale.

Commonly used module types are _protocol_, _router_ and _filter_. Protocol\
modules implement the communication between clients and MariaDB MaxScale, and\
between MariaDB MaxScale and backend servers. Routers inspect the queries from\
clients and decide the target backend. The decisions are usually based on\
routing rules and backend server status. Filters work on data as it passes\
through MariaDB MaxScale. Filter are often used for logging queries or modifying\
server responses.

A Google Group exists for MariaDB MaxScale. The Group is used to discuss ideas,\
issues and communicate with the MariaDB MaxScale community. Send email to[maxscale@googlegroups.com](mailto:maxscale@googlegroups.com) or use the[forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/maxscale) interface.

Bugs can be reported in the MariaDB Jira[jira.mariadb.org](https://jira.mariadb.org)

### Installing MariaDB MaxScale

Information about installing MariaDB MaxScale, either from a repository or by\
building from source code, is included in the [MariaDB MaxScale Installation\
Guide](../../../archive-of-2x.xx-versions/mariadb-maxscale-21-06/).

The same guide also provides basic information on running MariaDB MaxScale. More\
detailed information about configuring MariaDB MaxScale can be found in the[Configuration Guide](../maxscale-21-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-21-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-usage-scenarios.md).
