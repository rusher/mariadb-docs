# Change Data Capture (CDC) users

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a new MaxScale protocol that allows compatible\
clients to authenticate and register for Change Data Capture events. The new\
protocol must be use in conjunction with AVRO router which currently converts\
MariaDB binlog events into AVRO records. Clients connect to CDC listener and\
authenticate using credentials provided in a format described in the [CDC Protocol documentation](mariadb-maxscale-23-change-data-capture-cdc-protocol.md).

**Note**: If no users are found in that file or if it doesn't exist, the only\
available user will be the _service user_:

```
[avro-service]
type=service
router=avrorouter
source=replication-service
user=cdc_user
password=cdc_password
```

### Creating new CDC users

Starting with MaxScale 2.1, users can also be created through MaxAdmin:

```
maxadmin call command cdc add_user <service> <name> <password>
```

The should be the service name where the user is created. Older\
versions of MaxScale should use the _cdc\_users.py_ script.

```
bash$ cdc_users.py [-h] USER PASSWORD
```

The output of this command should be appended to the _cdcusers_ file at`/var/lib/maxscale/<service name>/`.

```
bash$ cdc_users.py user1 pass1 >> /var/lib/maxscale/avro-service/cdcusers
```

Users can be deleted by removing the related rows in 'cdcusers' file. For\
more details on the format of the _cdcusers_ file, read the [CDC Protocol documentation](mariadb-maxscale-23-change-data-capture-cdc-protocol.md).
