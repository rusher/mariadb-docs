# Management & Configuration

## Configuring Database Servers

This page explains how to use the Configuration Manager for viewing, configuring, and optimizing your MariaDB Cloud database services. It allows you to access configuration settings, understand topology-specific parameters, and make adjustments to system variables when needed.

## Autonomously Scale, Compute, & Storage

This page describes how to enable and manage autonomous horizontal (In/Out) and vertical (Up/Down) scaling of nodes and storage based on workload demands in order to maintain performance and reduce costs. It allows intelligent, rule-based auto-scaling features to manage database resources in response to dynamic workloads.

## Observability

This page covers how to gain insights by monitoring and analyzing your MariaDB Cloud databases with third-party integration tools such as Datadog or by collecting logs and metrics through the observability APIs feature.
