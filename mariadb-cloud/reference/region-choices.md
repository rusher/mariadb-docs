### Availability Zones and Latency Considerations

When deploying a highly available database service, nodes are distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within your selected region to maximize fault tolerance and protect against datacenter-level failures.

**Standard Replicated Topology:** Because standard Replicated topologies use asynchronous or semi-synchronous replication, deploying replicas across multiple AZs has a negligible impact on primary write latency.

**MariaDB Enterprise Cluster (Synchronous HA):** When deploying a MariaDB Enterprise Cluster across multiple AZs, you must account for inter-AZ network latency. Because it uses synchronous write-set certification, a transaction is not committed until all nodes in the cluster acknowledge it. The physical distance between Availability Zones in a given region will therefore introduce a slight commit latency to your write transactions.
