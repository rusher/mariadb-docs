# Quickstart Guides

This space offers step-by-step instructions for quickly deploying, configuring, and managing MariaDB Cloud databases using various methods and tools. Whether you prefer to use web-based portal, REST APIs, infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, or Python scripts, these methods will help you to walk through the complete process, from initial setup and connecting to the first database, to deployment, monitoring, and scaling of cloud database instances.

## Using the Portal

This page explains how to deploy a MariaDB Cloud service using the web-based MariaDB Cloud Portal interface with just a few clicks. It includes account creation, launching Serverless or Provisioned services, monitoring & scaling databases, and performing basic management operations.
