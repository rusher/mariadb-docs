# HA & DR

This section introduces MariaDB Cloud's robust, multi-layered capabilities for high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR). These features ensure data resilience, consistency, and continuous availability for mission-critical workloads in the event of regional outages or infrastructure failures. MariaDB Cloud leverages semi-synchronous replication, intelligent proxy-based failover, and cross-region or cross provider replication to enable durable, highly available deployments with minimal configuration.

## HA & Replicated Topology

MariaDB Cloud's intelligent proxy-based failover and semi-synchronous replication provide high availability, load balancing, and support for casual read configurations.

## Global Replication

Configures and implements cross-region or multi-cloud disaster recovery with Global Replication. This includes automating backup restoration, deploying additional services, and configuring replication across various regions or cloud providers to ensure high availability and failover beyond a single region.&#x20;

## Synchronous Replication

Set up cross-region or multi-cloud disaster recovery with Global Replication. This involves automating backup restoration, deploying necessary services, and configuring replication across different regions or cloud providers to maintain high availability and ensure failover beyond a single region.
