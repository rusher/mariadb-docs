# Enterprise Server Lifecycle

MariaDB Enterprise Server enables a predictable development and operations experience through an `enterprise lifecycle` This enterprise lifecycle incorporates optimized builds, predictable release behavior, and vendor support.

## Enterprise Server Builds

* Premium features meet enterprise scaling and operations requirements.
