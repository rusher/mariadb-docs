# MariaDB Enterprise Manager 25.10.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 22 Oct 2025

MariaDB Enterprise Manager 25.10.0 is the first Stable (GA) release of MariaDB Enterprise Manager — a centralized observability and management solution for MariaDB database fleet. It provides topology-aware monitoring for standalone servers, replication topologies, Galera clusters, and MaxScale, with an integrated Prometheus and Grafana for dashboards and alerting.

### Key Features

* Advanced Monitoring. Leverage the power of a built-in Grafana instance, complete with pre-packaged dashboards and production-ready alerts. The platform provides the flexibility to create custom dashboards, define unique alert rules, and route notifications to a wide range of destinations.
* Integration with Other Observability Solutions. Built on open standards, Enterprise Manager uses OpenTelemetry for metrics collection. Its integrated Prometheus time-series database exposes a query API, allowing you to seamlessly export metrics and integrate with your existing observability stack.
* Centralized Management. Gain a topology-based, centralized view of your entire database fleet. Enterprise Manager discovers and visualizes your replication and clustering setups, providing the ability to drill down into a specific MaxScale UI through a seamless single sign-on (SSO) experience.
* Workspace. The Workspace provides a powerful suite of tools for developers and DBAs. It features a rich Query Editor for running and debugging SQL and a visual ERD Designer for schema management and modeling across multiple database connections.
* Enterprise Security. Secure your management layer with robust security features. Authenticate users with your corporate identity provider (OIDC), enforce granular permissions with role-based access control (RBAC), and maintain compliance with a comprehensive audit log for all administrative actions.

### Packaging

* Enterprise Manager Server is delivered as a suite of Docker containers managed by Docker Compose.
* Enterprise Manager Agent is delivered via the mema-agent OS package via RPM/DEB packages (via MariaDB Enterprise Tools repository).
* Air-gapped installation is supported by exporting and transferring the Docker images and configuration archive to the target environment.
