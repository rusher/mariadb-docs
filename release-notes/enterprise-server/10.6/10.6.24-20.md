**Release date:** 11 Dec 2025

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.24-20 is a maintenance release of [MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6](whats-new.md). This release includes a variety of fixes.

## Backports

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/backports-10.6.24-20.md" %}

## Changes in Storage Engines <a href="#changes-in-storage-engines" id="changes-in-storage-engines"></a>

* This release incorporates MariaDB ColumnStore engine version 23.10.6

## Notable changes <a href="#notable-changes" id="notable-changes"></a>

* [Galera](https://app.gitbook.com/o/diTpXxF5WsbHqTReoBsS/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/) updated to 26.4.24
  * NOTE: Includes increasing the GCS protocol version, which prevents downgrades of individual nodes in the cluster as soon as all nodes have been updated
* Due to the impending EOL of Windows 10 22H2, and Windows 11 23H2, this will be the last release supporting these releases
* The HashiCorp Key Management Plugin has been updated to provide robust stability against Vault communication failures:
  * The plugin is now configured to use cached keys for all communication errors (not just timeouts), ensuring continuous operation when the Vault server is temporarily unreachable.
  * The default setting for using the cache on errors is now `ON`.
  * The default key cache timeout ([hashicorp\_key\_management\_cache\_timeout](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/hashicorp-key-management-plugin#hashicorp-key-management-cache-timeout)) has been increased to its maximum practical value (e.g., one year in milliseconds), maximizing key availability in the cache during extended service interruptions. ([MENT-1582](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-1582))<br>

## Issues Fixed <a href="#issues-fixed" id="issues-fixed"></a>

### Can result in hang or crash

* Assertion \`table\_share->tmp\_table != NO\_TMP\_TABLE || m\_lock\_type == 1' failed upon REBUILD PARTITION ([MDEV-20498](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20498))
* Spider: Assertion \`inited==RND' failed in handler::ha\_rnd\_end on DELETE ([MDEV-26540](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26540))
* Several bugs in SPATIAL INDEX page splitting logic could crash InnoDB if the PRIMARY KEY or the SPATIAL data is variable-length. ([MDEV-27675](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27675))
* Server hang with innodb\_file\_per\_table=0, innodb\_undo\_tablespaces=0 ([MDEV-29930](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29930))
* InnoDB could crash if the definition of the InnoDB persistent statistics tables were incorrect. ([MDEV-31740](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31740))
* Server crash on cleanup of non-fully-constructed-due-to-an-error CTE ([MDEV-32308](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-32308))
* Mariadb server crashed during insert ([MDEV-36134](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36134))
* InnoDB could potentially crash if there is any lock conflict on an internal FTS\_%\_CONFIG table of a FULLTEXT INDEX while one of the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA views INNODB\_TRX, INNODB\_LOCKS, or INNODB\_LOCK\_WAITS are being accessed. ([MDEV-36545](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36545))
* Fixed crashing bug when inserting into a tables with several nextval(sequence) default values. ([MDEV-37172](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37172))
* Inconsistency detected - create sequence ([MDEV-37366](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37366))
* Parallel replica worker crashes during backup at retrying ([MDEV-37453](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37453))
* Fixed a problem where the server would crash with a segfault when trying to drop duplicate domain ids in the same command ([MDEV-37885](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37885)), e.g.\
  `FLUSH BINARY LOGS DELETE_DOMAIN_ID=(0), BINARY LOGS DELETE_DOMAIN_ID=(0)`
* Item\_func\_hex doesn't check for max\_allowed\_packet ([MDEV-37947](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37947))
* MDL conflict between XA and DDL in MariaDB Enterprise Cluster ([MENT-2405](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2405))
* Race of rolling back and committing transaction to binlog ([MENT-2448](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2448))
* For large transactions (i.e. those whose data exceeds the binlog\_cache\_size limit and spills into tmp files), provides a general performance improvement and fixes a bug that would lead to binlog corruption where the large transaction would have its GTID written into the binary log, without any additional transaction data, if the server's --tmp-dir was full. ([MENT-2451](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2451))
* Bug in MariaDB Enterprise Backup where it would crash during the 'maria\_recovery' part. This could happen if server was doing repair or creating indexes while the backup was running ([MENT-2463](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2463))
* With --encrypt-binlog=ON if a node fails to apply a writeset it will crash the whole cluster due to a bug in Galera library encryption handling. Fixed in Galera library. ([MENT-2474](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2474))

### Can result in unexpected behaviour

* ALTER TABLE tbl\_a ADD PARTITION (PARTITION pt2) MSAN uninitalized read ([MDEV-36723](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36723))
* `mariadb-dump -T` did not encode table names like the server did for `frm` files, so some tables can be created in the server, but not dumped with `mariadb-dump -T`, for example, a table `con` on Windows. ([MDEV-37483](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37483))
* CHECK TABLE…EXTENDED could flag bogus corruption on a column prefix index. ([MDEV-37659](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37659))
* very long query cannot be killed quickly ([MDEV-37938](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37938))
* If the server was killed during an operation that creates a .ibd file, such as TRUNCATE TABLE, it could fail to recover. ([MDEV-37994](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37994))
* InnoDB partition table disallow local GTIDs ([MENT-2367](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2367))
* If the user specifies some tls-related parameters in spider table creation with odbc/mariadb backend, these parameters could be ill-formatted in the odbc connection string, causing them to be ignored by the driver. ([MENT-2407](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2407))
* innochecksum misinterprets doublewrite buffer pages ([MENT-2459](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MENT-2459))
