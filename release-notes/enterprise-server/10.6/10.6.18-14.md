# Release Notes for MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.18-14

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.18-14 is a maintenance release of [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb-enterprise-server/README.md) 10.6.

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.18-14 was released on 2024-06-11.

## Fixed Security Vulnerabilities

| CVE (with [cve.org](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/mariadb-enterprise-server-release-notes/mariadb-enterprise-server-10-6/cve.org) link) | CVSS base score |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [CVE-2024-21096](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21096)                                                                                               | 4.9             |

## Notable Changes

* Galera has been updated to `26.4.18`
  * The GCS protocol version has been changed, preventing a downgrade of individual nodes of a MariaDB Enterprise Cluster
* Changes to the use of the variable `optimizer_adjust_secondary_index_costs` ([MDEV-33306](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33306))
  * The default of the variable `optimizer_adjust_secondary_index_costs` changed from "0" to "" and is now of type `ENUM`
  * The variable can now be set to a combination of the following values separated by a ',':
    * `adjust_secondary_key_cost`: Update secondary key costs for ranges to be at least 5x of clustered primary key costs.
    * `disable_max_seek`: Disable 'max\_seek optimization' for secondary keys and slight adjustment of filter cost.
    * `disable_forced_index_in_group_by`: Disable automatic forced index in `GROUP BY` and make `GROUP BY` cost based instead of rule based. ALL Sets all of the above values.
  * Without changes in configuration or using the old integer values `0, 1, 2` for `optimizer_adjust_secondary_key_costs` this system variable works as before. This is to ensure that we do not break any existing applications.

## Changes in Storage Engines

* This release originally incorporated MariaDB ColumnStore engine version 23.10.1.
* This release now incorporates MariaDB ColumnStore engine version 23.10.2.

## Issues Fixed

### Can result in data loss

* With `--gtid-ignore-duplicate` set a transaction can be double-applied from another replication source if at applying the transaction from the initial source required retrying in parallel execution. ([MDEV-33475](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33475))

* With multiple GTID domains, optimistic parallel slave conflicts involving XA-PREPARE event group could not be resolved correctly which might cause unnecessary stop of the slave serve. ([MDEV-34042](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-34042))
* The `TIMESTAMP` value of `'1970-01-01 00:00:00'` can be inserted via a `INSERT ...FROM ... SELECT` in strict mode although it should result in an error ([MDEV-34088](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-34088))

* For encrypted table spaces an `ALTER` operation can hang when an encryption thread works on the same tablespace ([MDEV-33770](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33770))
* `EXPLAIN` statement that uses a subquery which has a query plan that A) will examine less than `@@expensive_subquery_limit` rows and B) will use join buffer could cause a crash. ([MDEV-21102](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-21102))
* For a SPIDER table, when deleting partitions from a table, the server can crash ([MDEV-33731](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33731))
* After an unsuccessful ALTER TABLE on an ARIA table due to a full temp space, any subsequent query results in the following error if it involves using temp: ([MDEV-33813](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33813))

```
ERROR 1021 (HY000): Disk full (./org/test1.MAI); waiting for someone to free some space... (errno: 28 "No space left on device")
```

* When replaying a binary log with mariadb-binlog, the tool can crash if the binary log includes statements related to sequences, like `SELECT NEXTVAL(s)` ([MDEV-31779](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31779))
* MariaDB Enterprise Backup fails with the following error message if the prepare step of the backup encounters a data directory which happens to store wsrep xid position in TRX SYS page: ([MDEV-33540](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33540))

```
InnoDB: Crash recovery is broken due to insufficient innodb_log_file_size
```

* Assertion failure when a client disconnected during transaction that is in the XA PREPARE state or when incomplete transaction was recovered from undo logs on server startup and not yet rolled back ([MDEV-33278](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33278))
* Failure with the following error message when streaming transaction in idle state is BF aborted: ([MDEV-33509](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33509))

```

* Assertion when user commits an empty transaction for DDL that was killed during certification: ([MDEV-32787](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-32787))

```

```

* Spider returns parsing failure on valid left join select by translating the on expression to `()` ([MDEV-33679](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33679))
* When creating a temporary InnoDB table with `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... AS SELECT ...` from an InnoDB table as a non SUPER / READ ONLY ADMIN user, the following error is shown instead of creating the table: ([MDEV-33889](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33889))

```
ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MariaDB server is running with the --read-only option so it cannot execute this statement
```

* `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE (without SELECT), INSERT ... SELECT, and CREATE ... LIKE` are not affected by this bug
* Phantom rows caused by `UPDATE` of `PRIMARY KEY` ([MDEV-32898](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-32898))
* Mariadb-dump trusts the server and does not validate the data. A modified dump file can include system commands used by the mariadb-client. Dumps are now loaded in the sandbox mode by default, a system call will result in an error ([MDEV-33727](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33727))
* Updating a case insensitive large unique key with an insensitive change of the value can result in a duplicate key error ([MDEV-29345](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29345))

* Original IP not shown in network related error messages when proxy\_protocol is in use ([MDEV-33506](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33506))
* Incorrect `DEFAULT` expression evaluated in UPDATE ([MDEV-33790](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33790))
* group by optimization incorrectly removing subquery where subject buried in a function ([MDEV-28621](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28621))

### Related to performance

* Replication with XA events can show decreased performance. Adapt parallel slave's round-robin scheduling to XA events ([MDEV-33668](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33668))
* Row locks for non-modified rows are not released at `XA PREPARE` ([MDEV-33454](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33454))
* Optimizer is sometimes choosing an index for queries with `GROUP BY` when it shouldn't, resulting in decreased performance. To protect compatibility to the current behavior `@@optimizer_adjust_secondary_key_costs="disable_forced_index_in_group_by"` has to be set to enable the fix ([MDEV-33306](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33306))
* Table is getting rebuild with `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` although it should be an instant operation not requiring a rebuild ([MDEV-33214](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33214))
* Semi-sync Wait Point `AFTER_COMMIT` Slow on Workloads with Heavy Concurrency ([MDEV-33551](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-33551))
* Aggregation functions fail to leverage uniqueness property ([MDEV-30660](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30660))
  * Generally, computing aggregate function with DISTINCT argument: `aggregate_func(DISTINCT col1, col2, ...)` requires producing a de-duplicated set of its arguments, which can be CPU-intensive
  * When we select from one table the argument list includes the table's PRIMARY (or UNIQUE) key:

```
SELECT aggregate_func(DISTINCT t1.primary_key, ...) FROM t1;
```

then the arguments are guaranteed not to have duplicates. Such cases are now detected allowing the optimizer to skip de-duplication.
