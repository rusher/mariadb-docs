# Release Notes for MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7



MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7 is a maintenance release of [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/mariadb-enterprise-server/README.md) 10.6. This release includes a variety of fixes.

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7 was released on 2023-03-13.

Users of MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7 are encouraged to upgrade to 10.6.12-8. Please see the [special upgrade procedure](release-notes-for-mariadb-enterprise-server-10-6-12-8.md#upgrade-procedure) that must be used.

### Backported Features

MariaDB Enterprise Server enables a predictable development and operations experience through an [enterprise lifecycle](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/products/mariadb-enterprise-server/lifecycle). These new features have been backported after reaching maturity in MariaDB Community Server.

* In previous releases, the number of undo logs was configurable before InnoDB was initialized. With this release, the number of undo logs can also be configured after install.
  * The number of undo logs is configured by the InnoDB system variable `--innodb-undo-tablespaces`.
  * Splitting undo logs over multiple tablespaces can reduce the size of a single tablespace, especially the InnoDB system tablespace.
  * In previous releases, the number of undo logs had to be configured before InnoDB was initialized, so changing the number of undo logs would require setting up a new server instance. With this backport from MariaDB Community Server 10.11, the number of undo logs can be changed so it will take effect with the next server start. (MENT-1650)

### Notable Changes

* Output for the [JSON\_DETAILED()](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/special-functions/json-functions/json_detailed) function has been optimized to reduce the number of lines needed. ([MDEV-19160](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19160))
  * For compatibility, [JSON\_PRETTY()](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/special-functions/json-functions/json_pretty) has been added as an alias to JSON\_DETAILED(). ([MDEV-19160](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19160))
* This release incorporates Galera library version 26.4.14.
* The names used by `information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES_ENCRYPTION.NAME` for undo tablespaces have been changed. ([MDEV-30119](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30119))\
  Starting with this release, names for the undo tablespaces use the format undo001.\
  In previous releases, names for the undo tablespaces used `NULL`.
* For MariaDB Enterprise Cluster SST with `MariaDB Enterprise Backup` backup execution (namely the block DDL phase) has been changed. In previous releases, the node was paused from the cluster, generating the following log file entry: ([MDEV-26391](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26391))

```
WSREP: Shifting SYNCED -> DONOR/DESYNCED
```

* Starting with this release, the mariabackup execution can be aborted if DDL statements happen during backup execution. This abortable backup execution is the optional feature which can be enabled/disabled by `wsrep_mode: BF_ABORT_MARIABACKUP`

### Issues Fixed

#### Can result in data loss

* When executing a `DELETE` or `UPDATE` with a subselect, the server can crash. ([MDEV-10087](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10087))

* After recovery, the server can crash with an error if `innodb_buffer_pool_size` is not large enough to recover in a single batch: `InnoDB: Tried to read ... bytes at offset` ([MDEV-30132](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30132))
* Race condition in foreign key locking during truncate. ([MDEV-29504](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29504))
* Possible hangs in some `B-tree` operations. ([MDEV-30400](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30400), [MDEV-29603](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29603))

* While executing an `ALTER TABLE` for a compressed `InnoDB` table, the server can crash. ([MDEV-28797](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28797))
* InnoDB fails to remove a newly created table or index from data dictionary and table cache and then crashes, if the `ALTER` to add a `FULLTEXT` index fails in the commit phase. ([MDEV-30393](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30393))
* When the query cache is enabled and a `DROP DATABASE` is called, the `DROP DATABASE` can hang and 100 percent CPU load can be seen. ([MDEV-29760](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29760))
