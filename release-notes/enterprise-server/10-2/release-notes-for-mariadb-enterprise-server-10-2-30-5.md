# Release Notes for MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.2.30-5

This fifth release of [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/mariadb-enterprise-server/README.md) 10.2 is a maintenance release, including a variety of fixes.

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.2.30-5 was released on 2020-01-06.

## Notable Changes

* [InnoDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) no longer sends unnecessary warnings to the error log about maximum row size for DDL statements when [innodb\_strict\_mode=OFF](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#innodb_strict_mode) and [log\_warnings<=2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#log_warnings) ([MDEV-20832](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20832))
* Redundant writes to the [InnoDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) redo log have been removed. ([MDEV-21024](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-21024))
* The default for the plugin load option plugin-maturity is now `stable` (MENT-240)
* [MariaDB Enterprise Audit](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/plugins/mariadb-audit-plugin/mariadb-audit-plugin-installation) and the MariaDB Audit plugin trace now add the user who initiated statements with the `DELAYED` option. In previous versions a system user was added. (MENT-237)

## Issues Fixed

### Can result in a hang or crash

* Primary (master) could crash when it executes [RESET MASTER](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/replication-statements/reset-master) and a replica (slave) reconnects having reset its connection status with the primary (e.g., `CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USE_GTID = slave_pos`). (MENT-19376)

### Can result in unexpected behavior

* Client received error `SEC_E_INVALID_TOKEN` when SSL is used and connecting to MariaDB Enterprise Server running on Microsoft Windows. ([MDEV-13492](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-13492))
* The restore of [Aria](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/aria) tables was not always possible if MariaDB Backup was using the parameters [--prepare](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/prepared-statements/prepare-statement) `--incremental` ([MDEV-18310](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18310))
* An incomplete result set was returned when [sort\_buffer\_size](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables#sort_buffer_size) was too small. ([MDEV-21044](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-21044))
