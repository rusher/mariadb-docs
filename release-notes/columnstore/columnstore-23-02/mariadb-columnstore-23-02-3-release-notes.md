Users of earlier MariaDB Enterprise ColumnStore releases are encouraged to upgrade.

## Issues Fixed

### Can result in a hang or crash

* When the GROUP\_CONCAT() function is used to produce relatively long strings, excessive memory can be used, which can cause PrimProc to crash with a segmentation fault. ([MCOL-5385](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-5385), [MCOL-5429](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-5429))
  * In previous releases, this issue can cause various types of messages to appear in the ColumnStore logs prior to the crash, such as:

```
CAL0005: ThreadPool: Caught exception during execution:  boost::thread_resource_error: Resource temporarily unavailable [generic:11]
CAL0000: TupleAggregateStep::doThreadedAggregate() caught std::bad_alloc         %%10%%
```

In previous releases, this issue can cause clients to see the following error message:

```
ERROR 1815 (HY000): Internal error: InetStreamSocket::readToMagic: Remote is closed
```

**Starting with this release, less memory should be used in this scenario.**

* When multiple ColumnStore threads or processes try to access a managed shared memory segment for the Extent Map concurrently, a read/write conflict can cause the processes to crash with a segmentation fault due to a race condition. ([MCOL-5487](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-5487))
  * In previous releases, cpimport, PrimProc, and DMLProc were observed to crash in this scenario.
  * Starting with this release, the internal RWLock is upgraded to a write lock when a shared memory segment remap is initiated (such as by a long running cpimport job), thus avoiding this read/write conflict.
