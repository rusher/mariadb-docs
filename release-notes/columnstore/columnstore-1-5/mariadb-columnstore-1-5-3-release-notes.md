## Notable Changes

* Comprehensive rewrite of installation, administration, cluster management, and failover logic. ([MCOL-3836](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-3836))
* Simplified installation
  * Users no longer need to execute columnstore-post-install and postConfigure
  * It is a plugin for MariaDB Enterprise Server.
  * It is packaged similar to other MariaDB Enterprise Server plugins.
  * See Installation for more details.
* Simplified administration:
  * mcsadmin has been removed. Instead, Enterprise ColumnStore 1.5 uses systemd for administration of single-node and multi-node deployments, and it also adds a new REST API for administration of multi-node deployments.
  * The new systemd service called mariadb-columnstore is used to manage ColumnStore's processes.
  * The new REST API is used to manage multi-node ColumnStore deployments.
  * The new REST API provides an interface for MariaDB MaxScale 2.5 to orchestrate the multi-node Enterprise ColumnStore deployment.
  * See OAM Replacement for more details.
* This release was the source for fixes previously backported to ColumnStore 1.4.4.
* This release includes correction of regressions present in ColumnStore 1.4.4 vs pre-integration.
