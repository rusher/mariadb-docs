## Upgrade workaround

With the fixing of [MCOL-59](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-59), the MariaDB Columnstore Platform Configuration file name has changed between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2. So if you have a 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 system and you want to upgrade to 1.0.2, you will need to do the following as part of the upgrade process. If you decide to reinstall 1.0.2 from scratch, this is isn’t required.

For details on how to execute the workaround please see [upgrading-mariadb-columnstore-from-102-to-103](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/columnstore/columnstore-1-0/broken-reference/README.md)

There are some known security issues. They are listed [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/rBEU9juWLfTDcdwF3Q14/security/columnstore-security-vulnerabilities)

* [MCOL-82](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-82): Subquery using IN with VIEW returns incorrect results. Queries selecting from view and using IN in where clause with a subquery on another view returns incorrect results.
* [MCOL-37](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-37): Following three window functions do not return correct value
  * FIRST\_VALUE
  * LEAD
  * LAG
* [MCOL-75](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-75) and [MCOL-74](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-74): NTH\_VALUE and LAST\_VALUE functions return syntax errors.
* [MCOL-73](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-73)): Wide table formatted display causes frontend to return error
  * MariaDB ColumnStore supports wide tables storage
  * Displaying the query results on a large number of columns without formatting the column works
  * Displaying the query results on a large number of columns with formatting causes error at MariaDB Server level
* [MCOL-45](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-45) : CREATE PROCEDURE fails.
  * Do not use stored procedure with this Alpha version [MCOL-16](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-16): LOAD DATA INFILE into datetime columns, data got saturated.
  * Do not use LOAD DATA INFILE when importing data into datetime columns
  * Use cpimport to bulk load data into MariaDB Columnstore instead. cpimports works correctly for datetime columns as well.
  * INSERT INTO works for datetime columns
* [MCOL-49](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-49): Drop table does not work if the PM node runs out of space.
* [MCOL-259](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-259): After starting MariaDB ColumnStore Service, if queries start within few nano-seconds, queries fail with “At least one DBRoot required for that query is offline“ message
  * Wait for 1 minute after the service is started, before starting to send queries
* [MCOL-271](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-271) and [MCOL-171](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-171): empty string and date/datetime values are treated as NULL. This means you cannot insert empty values into a NOT NULL column.
* [MCOL-256](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-256): Queries that have inline comments will produce erroneous results
* While Millisecond and Microsecond storage is supported for datetime, time and timestamp columns, at this time the query results cannot return millisecond and microseconds.
* UTF-8 Limitation
  * UTF-8 must be declared at the table level if the instance has been set up with a UTF-8 profile. Tables created with a non-matching character set will yield indeterminate results.
  * Viewing SQL output should be done using client software that supports UTF-8 character sets.
  * UTF-8 characters are not supported in object names.
