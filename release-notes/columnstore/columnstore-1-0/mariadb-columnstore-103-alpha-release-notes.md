There are some known security issues. They are listed [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/rBEU9juWLfTDcdwF3Q14/security/columnstore-security-vulnerabilities)

* [MCOL-82](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-82): Subquery using IN with VIEW returns incorrect results. Queries selecting from view and using IN in where clause with a subquery on another view returns incorrect results.
* [MCOL-37](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-37): Following three window functions do not return correct value
  * FIRST\_VALUE
  * LEAD
  * LAG
* [MCOL-75](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-75) and [MCOL-74](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-74): NTH\_VALUE and LAST\_VALUE functions return syntax errors.
* [MCOL-73](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-73)): Wide table formatted display causes frontend to return error
  * MariaDB ColumnStore supports wide tables storage
  * Displaying the query results on a large number of columns without formatting the column works
  * Displaying the query results on a large number of columns with formatting causes error at MariaDB Server level
* [MCOL-271](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-271) and [MCOL-171](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-171): empty string and date/datetime values are treated as NULL. This means you cannot insert empty values into a NOT NULL column.
* [MCOL-290](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-290): DecomSvr status incorrectly reported as Initial rather than Active.
* While Millisecond and Microsecond storage is supported for datetime, time and timestamp columns, at this time the query results cannot return millisecond and microseconds.
* UTF-8 Limitation
  * UTF-8 must be declared at the table level if the instance has been set up with a UTF-8 profile. Tables created with a non-matching character set will yield indeterminate results.
  * Viewing SQL output should be done using client software that supports UTF-8 character sets.
  * UTF-8 characters are not supported in object names.
