  * Support for Debian 9, Debian 10, and Ubuntu 18.04 have been removed.

### CPU Compatibility

* When ColumnStore is installed and started, ColumnStore's binaries check the system's CPU to confirm that the CPU supports the SIMD instructions required by ColumnStore. ([MCOL-5180](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL-5180))
  * On x86\_64, ColumnStore requires SSE4.2.

  * If the ColumnStore installation scripts determine that the required SIMD instructions are not supported, the following error is raised:

```
error: this machine CPU lacks of support for Intel SSE4.2 or ARM Advanced SIMD instructions. Columnstore requires one of this instruction sets, installation aborted
```

**If the ColumnStore binaries are started and determine that the required SIMD instructions are not supported, the following error is raised:**

```
Unsupported CPU architecture. ARM Advanced SIMD or x86_64 SSE4.2 required; aborting.
```
