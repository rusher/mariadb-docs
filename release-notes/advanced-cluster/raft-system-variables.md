### raft-node-id

Unique node identifier. The identifier can be either a human-readable string up to 15 characters long or a UUID. If human-readable name is used, it must be unique within the cluster. If another node with the same name already exists in the cluster, the newly added node will fail connecting the cluster. The special value 'auto' is reserved for generating a UUID whenever the server starts from a clean state. This is mainly useful for test scenarios where the grastate.dat is removed, and the node is expected to rejoin the cluster before the previous instance is evicted from the group.

| Property     | Value                                        |

| Data Type    | String                                       |
| Range        | Human-readable string (max 15 chars) or UUID |
| Default      | auto                                         |


### raft-node-weight

Node weight for replication and voting quorum. The default weight is 1, all nodes in the cluster have the same weight in voting and replication. ⚠️ PRODUCTION WARNING: Using unequal weights in a cluster is unsafe for production workloads. Weighted quorum does not guarantee that data is replicated on the majority of servers before log events are committed on the leader, which can lead to data loss scenarios. This setting is mainly useful for testing and should not be used in production.

| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Command Line |                   |

| Default      | 20                |


### raft-session-timeout

Timeout after which session to replication system is considered expired if there is no activity. If the node cannot communicate with the leader within this time period, it will be evicted from the cluster (seconds).
