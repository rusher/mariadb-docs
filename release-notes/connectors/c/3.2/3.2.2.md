[Download](https://mariadb.com/downloads/#connectors)[Release Notes](3.2.2.md)[Changelog](../changelogs/3.2/3.2.2.md)[About MariaDB Connector/C](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/about-mariadb-connector-c/README.md)

**Release date:** 29 Jun 2021

This is a [_**Release Candidate (RC)**_](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB\
Connector/C, formerly known as MariaDB Client Library for C.

**For a description of this library see the**[**MariaDB Connector/C**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/CjGYMsT2MVP4nd3IyW2L/mariadb-connector-c) **page.**

## Notable changes

In addition to various minor bug fixes, in this release we have updated the minor version number (skipped over `3.2.1`) so that this series is in sync with the [MariaDB 10.6](../../../community-server/10.6/what-is-mariadb-106.md) minor version number. Going forward, releases in the [Connector/C 3.2](connector-c-3.2-changes-and-improvements.md) series will correspond to the same minor version of [MariaDB 10.6](../../../community-server/10.6/what-is-mariadb-106.md). e.g. Connector/C 3.2.2 is included in [MariaDB 10.6.2](../../../community-server/10.6/10.6.2.md).
