## Notable Changes

* The default connection character set is `utf8mb4`. ([CONCPP-91](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-91))
* Re-execution or destruction on any type of statement object closes all of its result-sets. ([CONCPP-88](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-88))
* `ResultSet` streaming is supported. The `defaultFetchSize` connection option sets the default number of rows in a result-sets retrieved at a time. The `setFetchSize` statement method sets number of rows for the statement. ([CONCPP-72](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-72))

## Notable API Changes

* `ResultSet` get methods are `const` ([CONCPP-86](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-86))

* `SQLString` class supports `find` methods. ([CONCPP-90](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-90))
