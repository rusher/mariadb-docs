This is a [_**Stable (GA)**_](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md) release of MariaDB Connector/C++.

This is a GA release of the [MariaDB Connector/C++ 1.1](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/about-mariadb-connector-cpp/README.md) series, the interface between C++ applications, and MariaDB Server. MariaDB Connector/C++ enables development of C++ applications using a JDBC-based API, which is also used by MariaDB Connector/JDBC.

MariaDB Connector/C++ in its current implementation uses the MariaDB protocol via the MariaDB Connector/C API. Connector/C 3.3.11 is used in this release.

## Bugs Fixed

* `getMoreResults()` could pick other statement's result ([CONCPP-132](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-132))
* Driver failed to cache multiple results, i.e., if application executed a query while other query hadn't iterated thru all its results, the connection would get out of sync ([CONCPP-133](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-133))

## Installation

* [Install MariaDB Connector/C++](https://app.gitbook.com/s/CjGYMsT2MVP4nd3IyW2L/mariadb-connector-cpp/install-mariadb-connector-cpp)
