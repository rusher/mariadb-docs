# MariaDB MaxScale 25.01.3 Release Notes

Release 25.01.3 is a GA release.

NOTE: The MaxScale package has been renamed from maxscale-enterprise back
      to maxscale, which may, when repositories are used, require 25.01.1 and
      25.01.2 to be removed before installing 25.01.3.

This document describes the changes in release 25.01.3, when compared to the
previous release in the same series.

If you are upgrading from an older major version of MaxScale, please read the
[upgrading document](../Upgrading/Upgrading-To-MaxScale-25.01.md) for
