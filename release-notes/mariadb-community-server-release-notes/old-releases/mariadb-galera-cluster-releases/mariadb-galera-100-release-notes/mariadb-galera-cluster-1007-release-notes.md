## Includes [MariaDB 10.0.7](../../release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/mariadb-1007-release-notes.md) and Galera Cluster

MariaDB Galera Cluster 10.0.7 includes[MariaDB 10.0.7](../../release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/mariadb-1007-release-notes.md) with Codership additions\
(`lp:codership-mysql/5.5` till revision `3944`) and[Galera 25.3.2](https://codership.com/content/using-galera-cluster).\
This version of MariaDB Galera Cluster supports `wsrep` API v25 which means\
MariaDB Galera Cluster can be used with either a 25.2.x or 25.3.x Galera`wsrep` provider. A 25.3.x `wsrep` provider is included in the MariaDB\
repositories. And both 25.3.x and 25.2.x `wsrep` providers are available on the downloads page.

See the [MariaDB 10.0.7 Release Notes](../../release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/mariadb-1007-release-notes.md) and[Changelog](../../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-100-series/mariadb-1007-changelog.md) for more information on the changes in\
MariaDB.

Note: If Galera v2 and v3 are both being used in the cluster, MariaDB with Galera v3 must be started with wsrep\_provider\_options='socket.checksum=1' in order to make it backward compatible with Galera v2.
