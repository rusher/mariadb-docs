## Updates and fixes in this version

* This release is mainly a bug-fix release.
* Codership changes: [github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep/tree/5.6](https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep/tree/5.6) (till commit 21a2415).
* The [Galera library](https://codership.com/content/using-galera-cluster) used\
  by MariaDB Galera Cluster and included in the MariaDB repositories is\
  currently at version 25.3.9.
* [MDEV-5146](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-5146): Updates from LOAD DATA on a partitioned table were not getting replicated to other nodes in the cluster
* [MDEV-8208](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-8208): A node could crash during startup
* [MDEV-8834](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-8834): In a concurrent scenario, a session was able to write to a read\_only node

## Notes

* Running MariaDB Galera Cluster 5.5 and 10.0 nodes in a cluster is not\
  supported ([MDEV-6257](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6257))
* This version of MariaDB Galera Cluster supports `wsrep` API v25 which means\
  MariaDB Galera Cluster can be used with either a 25.2.x or 25.3.x\
  Galera `wsrep` provider. A 25.3.x `wsrep` provider is included in the\
  MariaDB repositories and is also available from the[downloads](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb-galera/5.5.42) page.
* See the [MariaDB 10.0.22 Release Notes](../../release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/mariadb-10022-release-notes.md) and[Changelog](../../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-100-series/mariadb-10022-changelog.md) for more information on the changes in\
  MariaDB.
* On Ubuntu and Debian, the Galera Arbitrator daemon (garbd) and the galera\
  library are in two separate packages. The packages are named galera-3\
  and galera-arbitrator-3. When installing MariaDB Galera Cluster on Ubuntu and\
  Debian (the mariadb-galera-server package), the galera-3 package will be\
  automatically installed. You can then install the arbitrator package on a\
  separate node (recommended) or on one of the nodes running\
  mariadb-galera-server (not recommended).

Note: If Galera 25.2.x and 25.3.x are both being used in the cluster, MariaDB\
with Galera 25.3.x must be started with[wsrep\_provider\_options='socket.checksum=1'](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/wsrep_provider_options#socketchecksum) in order to make it backward\
compatible with Galera v2. Galera wsrep providers other than 25.3.x or 25.2.x\
are not supported.

Thanks, and enjoy MariaDB Galera Cluster!
