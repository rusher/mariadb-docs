## Includes Galera wsrep provider version 23.2.6

The Galera library on Ubuntu/Debian, and x86\_64 versions of Red Hat 6, CentOS\
6, and Fedora has been updated to version 23.2.6.

## Packaging Fixes

This version includes several packaging fixes including a fix for [MDEV-4229](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4229)\
regarding binaries for Debian Wheezy.

One packaging fix that still exists is one that prevents the installation of\
the wsrep package on Fedora systems ([MDEV-4141](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4141)). It is hoped this issue will be fixed soon. When it is this paragraph will be updated. For now, Fedora packages are in the repository, but the galera package must be installed manually, and may not work even then.

## Other fixes

* [MDEV-4953](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4953) Delete on a partioned table is not replicated
* LOAD DATA INFILE now supports big data files by introducing transaction\
  splitting, which is controlled via the [wsrep\_load\_data\_splitting](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables) global\
  variable
