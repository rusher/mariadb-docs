## Notes about this release

* MariaDB Galera Cluster 5.5.38 includes [MariaDB 5.5.38](../../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/mariadb-5538-release-notes.md) with Codership\
  additions (`lp:codership-mysql/5.5` till revision `3997`) and[Galera 25.3.5](https://codership.com/content/using-galera-cluster).
* This version of MariaDB Galera Cluster supports `wsrep` API v25 which means\
  MariaDB Galera Cluster can be used with either a 25.2.x or 25.3.x\
  Galera `wsrep` provider. A 25.3.x `wsrep` provider is included in the\
  MariaDB repositories and both 25.3.x and 25.2.x wsrep providers are available\
  on the [downloads](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb-galera/5.5.38) page.
* wsrep\_sst\_rsync (sst script) in MariaDB Galera Cluster 5.5.38 uses `lsof` which might not be installed by default on some linux distributions. It has to be installed if the `wsrep_sst_method` is set to `rsync` (default). Package managers should be able to automatically resolve this dependency ([MDEV-6264](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6264)).
* Galera rpm packages had a file conflicting with Filesystem package ([MDEV-4218](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4218)), which caused installation to fail. Fixed Galera packages are now available for the following flavors : Fedora 19, Fedora 20 and CentOS 6.

See the [MariaDB 5.5.38 Release Notes](../../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/mariadb-5538-release-notes.md) and[Changelog](../../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-55-series/mariadb-5538-changelog.md) for more information on the changes in\
MariaDB.

Note: If Galera 25.2.x and 25.3.x are both being used in the cluster, MariaDB\
with Galera 25.3.x must be started with`wsrep_provider_options='socket.checksum=1'` in order to make it backward\
compatible with Galera v2. Galera wsrep providers other than 25.3.x or 25.2.x\
are not supported.
