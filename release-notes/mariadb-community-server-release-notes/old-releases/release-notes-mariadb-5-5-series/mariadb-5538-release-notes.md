This is a [_**Stable**_](../../../mariadb-release-criteria.md) _**(GA)**_ release. In general this\
means that there are no known serious bugs, except for those marked as feature\
requests, that no bugs were fixed since last release that caused notable code\
changes, and that we believe the code is ready for general usage (based on bug\
inflow).

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
