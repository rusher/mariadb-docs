## Notable Changes

This is the second stable release in the [MariaDB 10.2](what-is-mariadb-102.md) series.

A file format compatibility bug that was introduced in [MariaDB 10.2.2](mariadb-1022-release-notes.md) was fixed in this version of MariaDB. Creating tables with the attribute [page\_compressed=yes](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-page-compression) created InnoDB internal data dictionary records that are incompatible with [MariaDB 10.1](../release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md). [MariaDB 10.2.7](mariadb-1027-release-notes.md) and later will write the dictionary records in a format that is compatible with [MariaDB 10.1](../release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) and will also support the malformed metadata from affected 10.2 versions.**This may prevent a downgrade to earlier** [**MariaDB 10.2**](what-is-mariadb-102.md) **versions.**[See the commit for details.](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/72378a25830184f91005be7e80cfb28381c79f23)
