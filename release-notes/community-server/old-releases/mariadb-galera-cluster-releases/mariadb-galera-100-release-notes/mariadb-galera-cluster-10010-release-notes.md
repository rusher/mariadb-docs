For a list of changes made in MariaDB Galera Cluster 10.0.10, with links to\
detailed information on each push, see the [MariaDB Galera Cluster 10.0.10 Changelog](../mariadb-galera-100-changelogs/mariadb-galera-cluster-10010-changelog.md).

## Updates and fixes in this version

* Codership changes: `lp:codership-mysql/5.5` (till rev `3968`) & `lp:codership-mysql/5.6` (till rev `4065`).
* [Galera library](https://codership.com/content/using-galera-cluster) versions: 25.3.5, 25.2.9
* Supported wsrep interface version: 25

## Notes

* Compatibility: Wsrep providers (Galera libraries) other than version 25.x.xx are not supported.
* New: This release includes a new method for snapshot state transfer, `wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2`. This method of state snapshot transfer can be configured using the `--wsrep_sst_method=xtrabackup-v2` option. Its use requires Xtrabackup (>= 2.1.6) and other software packages like socat, nc, and tar.
* Note: Completely uninstall broken/partially installed 10.0.7-galera deb packages prior to installing this version, as they may conflict with 10.0.10-galera packages.

See the [MariaDB 10.0.10 Release Notes](../../release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/mariadb-10010-release-notes.md) and [Changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-100-series/mariadb-10010-changelog.md) for more information on the changes in\
MariaDB.

Note: If Galera v2 and v3 are both being used in the cluster, MariaDB with\
Galera v3 must be started with `wsrep_provider_options='socket.checksum=1'`\
in order to make it backward compatible with Galera v2.

Thanks, and enjoy MariaDB Galera Cluster!
