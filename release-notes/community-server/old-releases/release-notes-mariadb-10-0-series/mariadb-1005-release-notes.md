**Release date:** 7 Nov 2013

[MariaDB 10.0](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) is the current development version of MariaDB. It is an evolution\
of [MariaDB 5.5](../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) the MariaDB 5.5 series with several entirely new\
features not found anywhere else and with backported and\
reimplemented features from MySQL 5.6.

[MariaDB 10.0.5](mariadb-1005-release-notes.md) is a [_**Beta**_](../../about/release-criteria.md) release. This is the\
sixth 10.0-based release, and the first beta release. We are releasing it now\
to get it into the hands of any who might want to test it. All features planned\
for inclusion in the stable (GA) [MariaDB 10.0](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) series are included in this\
release. This is still a beta however, not a final, production-ready, release.

## Based on [MariaDB 5.5](../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md)

The [MariaDB 10.0](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) series builds off of the [MariaDB 5.5 series.](../release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) It includes\
completely new features and features imported and backported from MySQL 5.6.

In most respects [MariaDB](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/kb/en/mariadb/README.md) will work exactly as MySQL: all commands,\
interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.
