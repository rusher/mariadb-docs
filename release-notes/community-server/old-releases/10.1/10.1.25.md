## Notable Changes

* MariaDB can no longer be compiled with OpenSSL version 0.9.8 and below. The last 0.9.8 release was in December 2015, it is out of support and is no longer getting security fixes.
* [MariaDB Backup](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-usage/backup-and-restore/mariadb-backup/) is now beta
* As per the [MariaDB Deprecation Policy](../../about/platform-deprecation-policy.md), this will be the last release of [MariaDB 10.1](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) for Ubuntu 16.10 "Yakkety"
* Fixes for the following [security vulnerabilities](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/security/securing-mariadb/security):
  * CVE-\`-\`\`\`

A file format compatibility bug that was introduced in [MariaDB 10.1.0](10.1.0.md) was fixed in [MariaDB 10.1.21](10.1.21.md).\
Using [page\_compression](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-page-compression) or non-default [innodb\_page\_size](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables) created files that were incompatible with [MariaDB 10.0](../10.0/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) or MySQL 5.6. [MariaDB 10.1.21](10.1.21.md) and higher will convert affected files from earlier [MariaDB 10.1](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) releases to a compatible format.**This prevents a downgrade to earlier** [**MariaDB 10.1**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) **versions.**[See the commit for details.](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/ab1e6fefd869242d962cb91a006f37bb9ad534a7)

Updating from [MariaDB 10.1.21](10.1.21.md) to [MariaDB 10.1.22](10.1.22.md) or higher is **highly recommended** due to two high-priority regression fixes. See [MDEV-11842](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-11842) and [MDEV-12075](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-12075) for details.
