A file format compatibility bug that was introduced in [MariaDB 10.1.0](10.1.0.md) was fixed in [MariaDB 10.1.21](10.1.21.md).\
Using [page\_compression](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-page-compression) or non-default [innodb\_page\_size](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables) created files that were incompatible with [MariaDB 10.0](../10.0/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-0.md) or MySQL 5.6. [MariaDB 10.1.21](10.1.21.md) and higher will convert affected files from earlier [MariaDB 10.1](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) releases to a compatible format.**This prevents a downgrade to earlier** [**MariaDB 10.1**](changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) **versions.**[See the commit for details.](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/ab1e6fefd869242d962cb91a006f37bb9ad534a7)
