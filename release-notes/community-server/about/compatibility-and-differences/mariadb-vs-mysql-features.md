Disabled in [MariaDB 5.5](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) only.)
* [SphinxSE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/sphinx-storage-engine) (In [MariaDB 5.2](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-2-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-2.md) and later)

#### Speed Improvements

* MariaDB now provides much faster privilege checks for setups with many user accounts or many database
* The new [FLUSH SSL](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/flush-commands/flush) command allows SSL certificates to be reloaded without restarting the server
* Many optimizer enhancements in [MariaDB 5.3](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-3-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-3.md). [Subqueries](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/joins-subqueries/subqueries) are now finally usable.\
  The complete list and a comparison with MySQL is [here](optimizer-feature-comparison-matrix.md).\
  A benchmark can be found [here](https://mariadb.com/blog/mariadb-53-optimizer-benchmark).
* Faster and safer replication:[Group commit for the binary log](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/group-commit-for-the-binary-log). This makes many setups that use replication and lots of updates [more than 2x times faster](https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150211546215933).
* [Parallel replication](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/parallel-replication) — new in 10.0
* [Improvements](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/development-articles/general-info/quality/benchmarks-and-long-running-tests/benchmarks/mariadb-53-asynchronous-io-on-windows-with-innodb) for InnoDB asynchronous IO subsystem on Windows.
* Indexes for the [MEMORY(HEAP)](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine) engine are faster. According to a simple test, 24% faster on INSERT for integer index and 60% faster for index on a CHAR(20) column. Fixed in [MariaDB 5.5](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-5-5-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-5-5.md) and MySQL 5.7.
* [Segmented Key Cache](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/segmented-key-cache) for MyISAM. Can speed up MyISAM tables with up to 4x\
  — new in 5.2
* [Adjustable hash size](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/myisam-storage-engine/myisam-system-variables#key_cache_file_hash_size) for MyISAM and Aria. This can greatly improve shutdown time (from hours to minutes) if using a lot of MyISAM/Aria tables with delayed keys — new in 10.0.13
* [CHECKSUM TABLE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/table-statements/checksum-table) is faster.
* We improved the performance of character set conversions (and removed\
  conversions when they were not really needed).\
  Overall speed improvement is 1-5 % (according to sql-bench) but can be\
  higher for big result sets with all characters between 0x00-0x7f.
* [Pool of Threads in MariaDB 5.1](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/buffers-caches-and-threads/thread-pool/thread-pool-in-mariadb-51-53) and even better in [MariaDB 5.5](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/buffers-caches-and-threads/thread-pool/thread-pool-in-mariadb). This allows MariaDB to run with 200,000+ connections and with a notable speed improvement when using many connections.
* Several speed improvements when a client connects to MariaDB. Many of the improvements were done in [MariaDB 10.1](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-1-series/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-10-1.md) and [MariaDB 10.2](../../old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-2-series/what-is-mariadb-102.md).
* There are some improvements to the DBUG code to make its execution faster when debug is compiled in but not used.
* Our use of the Aria storage engine enables faster complex queries (queries\
  which normally use disk-based temporary tables). The [Aria](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/aria) storage\
  engine is used for internal temporary tables, which should give a speedup\
  when doing complex selects. Aria is usually faster for temporary tables when\
  compared to MyISAM because Aria caches row data in memory and normally\
  doesn't have to write the temporary rows to disk.
* The test suite has been extended and now runs much faster than before, even though it\
  tests more things.

#### Extensions & New Features

We've added a lot of new features to MariaDB. If a\
patch or feature is useful, safe, and stable — we make\
every effort to include it in MariaDB. The most notable features are:

* Support introduced for [System-versioned tables](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-structure/temporal-tables/system-versioned-tables). Allows queries to access both current and historic data, aiding in managing retention, analysis and point-in-time recovery. — new in 10.3
* [ALTER TABLE... DROP COLUMN](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-definition/alter/alter-table#drop-column) can now run as Instant operations. Can also now change the ordering of columns. — new in 10.4
* Support introduced for password expiration, using the [user password expiry](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/security/user-account-management/user-password-expiry) — new in 10.4
* In order to support the use of multiple authentication plugins for a single user, the [mysql.user](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-user-table) system table has been retired in favor of the [mysql.glob\_priv](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements-and-structure/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/mysql-global_priv-table) system table. — new in 10.4
* The [unix\_socket authentication plugin](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/plugins/authentication-plugins/authentication-plugin-unix-socket) is now the default on Unix-like systems. This represents a major change to authentication in MariaDB — new in 10.4

#### Better Testing

* More tests in the test suite.
* Bugs in tests fixed.
* Test builds with different configure options to get better feature testing.
* Remove invalid tests. (e.g. don't test feature ''X'' if that feature is not\
  in the tested build)

#### Fewer Warnings and Fewer Bugs

* Bugs are bad. Fix as many bugs as possible and try to not introduce new ones.
* Compiler warnings are also bad. Eliminate as many compiler warnings as\
  possible.

#### Truly Open Source

* All code in MariaDB is released under GPL, LGPL or BSD.
* MariaDB does not have closed source modules like the ones that can be found in MySQL Enterprise Edition. In fact, all the closed source features in MySQL 5.5 Enterprise Edition are found in the MariaDB open source version.
* MariaDB client libraries (for C, for Java (JDBC), for Windows (ODBC)) are released under LGPL to allow linking with closed source software. MySQL client libraries are released under GPL that does not allow linking with closed source software.
* MariaDB includes test cases for all fixed bugs. Oracle doesn't provide test cases for new bugs fixed in MySQL 5.5.
* All [bugs](https://jira.mariadb.org) and [development plans](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/compatibility-and-differences/broken-reference/README.md) are public.
* MariaDB is [developed by the community](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/compatibility-and-differences/broken-reference/README.md) in true open source spirit.
