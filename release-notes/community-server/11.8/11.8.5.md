## Notable Items

* [MDEV-38068](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-38068): This issue caused a partial data deletion when using the DELETE statement on MyISAM or Aria tables under specific conditions. InnoDB tables are not affected by this issue. Specifically, when a DELETE statement included a WHERE clause with a non-unique indexed column compared for equality with a literal (col=const) and the execution plan showed a "range" operation on that index, the query could fail to delete all matching rows. Users of MariaDB Community Server 11.8.4 are strongly advised to upgrade immediately to 11.8.5.
