## Notable Items

### Storage Engines

#### InnoDB

* The InnoDB purge subsystem will no longer reset transaction identifiers in freshly inserted records, because it did severely hurt performance in some workloads. ([MDEV-16168](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-16168))
* InnoDB could crash after a DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE, OPTIMIZE TABLE or a table-rebuilding ALTER TABLE if innodb\_adaptive\_hash\_index entries existed in the table. ([MDEV-26599](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26599))
* InnoDB could crash if the definition of the InnoDB persistent statistics tables were incorrect. ([MDEV-31740](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31740))
* Workloads that are bound by innodb\_log\_file\_size would write out unnecessarily many data pages in an attempt to advance the log checkpoint. ([MDEV-35155](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-35155))
* ALTER TABLE could fail to update InnoDB persistent statistics. ([MDEV-35163](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-35163))
* Some lock elision code that was detrimental to performance was removed. ([MDEV-36190](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36190))
* MariaDB upgrade fails when using innodb\_encrypt\_tables=ON and innodb\_checksum\_algorithm=crc32, which is not the default. innodb\_checksum\_algorithm=crc32 is used only if explicitly specified or if the table has been created which MariaDB 10.4 or a prior version ([MDEV-36556](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36556))
* innochecksum misinterprets doublewrite buffer pages ([MDEV-37138](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37138))
* The performance of ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON as well as the counter innodb\_buffer\_pool\_read\_requests was improved. ([MDEV-37152](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37152))
* Crash recovery after bulk load data reports corruption ([MDEV-37192](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37192))
* When a page needs to be read into the InnoDB buffer pool, concurrent access to the page will avoid some hash table lookup and busy waiting. ([MDEV-37244](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37244))
* InnoDB could crash during the crash recovery of a corrupted database. ([MDEV-37412](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37412))
* There was a very small chance of InnoDB crashing or misbehaving after an attempt to reduce innodb\_buffer\_pool\_size. ([MDEV-37447](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37447))
* The forced use of THD accessor functions hurts InnoDB performance ([MDEV-37619](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37619))
* CHECK TABLE…EXTENDED could flag bogus corruption on a column prefix index. ([MDEV-37659](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37659))
* During workload after crash recovery, an incorrect (too large) innodb\_buffer\_pool\_pages\_dirty could be reported. ([MDEV-37677](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37677))
* In rare cases, shutdown might hang ([MDEV-37728](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37728))
* Lock checks for secondary indexes were unnecessarily accessing some history and could access freed BLOB pages that correspond to column prefixes. ([MDEV-37753](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37753))
* Remove InnoDB "optimizations" for debug\_no\_sync ([MDEV-37843](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37843))

* Failure to detect corruption during backups of Aria table ([MDEV-37520](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37520))

#### Connect

* BsonGet\_String and JsonGet\_String with a NULL argument resulted in an empty string warning. This now has an "Argument is NULL" warning. ([MDEV-37633](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37633))

#### Federated

* FederatedX error 10000 on multi-table UPDATE/DELETE ([MDEV-29874](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29874))

#### MyISAM

* myisamchk -V crashes ([MDEV-37505](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37505))

### Full-text Search

* InnoDB could potentially crash if there is any lock conflict on an internal FTS\_%\_CONFIG table of a FULLTEXT INDEX while one of the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA views INNODB\_TRX, INNODB\_LOCKS, or INNODB\_LOCK\_WAITS are being accessed. ([MDEV-36545](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36545))
* The minimum value of the parameter innodb\_ft\_min\_token\_size was increased to 1, similar to the parameter ft\_min\_word\_len. ([MDEV-37423](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37423))

* IS TRUE incorrectly converts outer join to inner ([MDEV-37653](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37653))
* Wrong result with Loose Scan on QUICK\_GROUP\_MIN\_MAX\_SELECT WITH TIES ([MDEV-37901](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37901))
* disable\_index\_merge\_plans causes SELECT data loss when more than 100 ORs ([MDEV-37913](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37913))

### Server

* LIMIT ROWS EXAMINED prematurely triggers during optimization ([MDEV-22241](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-22241))
* Exchange partition with virtual columns fails ([MDEV-34033](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-34033))

* LOCATE(X,Y,NULL) is not NULL ([MDEV-37740](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37740))

### Locking

* DDL in procedure propagates no locking to tables locked by DML ([MDEV-16686](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-16686))

### Platform RedHat

* On Fedora, RHEL, and derivatives, depend on the mysql-selinux-1.0.14 package that provides the correct selinux rules for the /usr/sbin/mariadbd that is installed. ([MDEV-24941](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-24941))

### Platform Windows

* On Windows, when MSI package is installed, with ADDLOCAL parameter passed to msiexec.exe, and Visual C++ Redistributable package is not installed on the target machine, installation may fail during "create database" step. ([MDEV-36938](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36938))

### Stored routines

* Crash when calling stored function in FOR loop argument ([MDEV-26115](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26115))

### GIS

* Several bugs in SPATIAL INDEX page splitting logic could crash InnoDB if the PRIMARY KEY or the SPATIAL data is variable-length. ([MDEV-27675](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27675))
* Wrong results for self-touching shapes. ([MDEV-31499](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31499))

### Optimizer - CTE

* Server crash on cleanup of non-fully-constructed-due-to-an-error CTE ([MDEV-32308](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-32308))

### Packaging

* A tmpfiles file will now create /run/mysqld path on Debian/Ubuntu packaged distributions. ([MDEV-15502](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-15502))
* server cannot load client plugins on Debian ([MDEV-34744](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-34744))
* Previous systemd warnings in recent systemd versions about uninitialised environment variables have been corrected. ([MDEV-35904](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-35904))
* The PrivateDevices=false directive in the systemd service has been removed as it was an old kernel incompatibility that this directived worked around. With this, the MariaDB is restricted further. Those using InnoDB on raw devices will need to add an override for this. See https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/systemd#useful-systemd-options ([MDEV-36721](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36721))

### Backup

* Parallel slave worker crashes During Backup at retrying ([MDEV-37453](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37453))

### Scripts & Clients

* `mariadb-dump -T` did not encode table names like the server did for `frm` files, so some tables can be created in the server, but not dumped with `mariadb-dump -T`, for example, a table `con` on Windows. ([MDEV-37483](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37483))
* Using mytop with DBD-MariaDB and host=localhost specified resulted in an unexpected error because the driver did not expect a port 3306. Contribution thanks to Jean Weisbuch. ([MDEV-37852](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37852))

### Authentication and Privilege System

* Backport MDEV-9804 "Implement a caching\_sha2\_password plugin" to MariaDB Community Server 11.4/11.8 ([MDEV-37600](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37600))

### Versioned Tables

* REPLACE on a precise-versioned table returns duplicate key error (ER\_DUP\_ENTRY) ([MDEV-15990](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-15990))

### Prepared Statements

* Parameterized PS converts error to warning, causes replication problems ([MDEV-34046](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-34046))

### Data Definition - Create Table

* Innodb did not handle case-sensitivity on Windows correctly prior to this fix in its data dictionary, converting all names to lowercase. This resulted in inconsistency, if data directory was in case-sensitive NTFS directory, as well as in situations when data directory was copied from Windows to Unix systems. This is fixed in this patch. ([MDEV-34953](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-34953))

### mariabackup

* Fixed bug in maria-backup where maria-backup would crash during the 'maria\_recovery' part. This could happen if server was doing repair or creating indexes while the backup was running. ([MDEV-36860](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36860))

### Replication

* Fix --master-retry-count=0 not infinite as described ([MDEV-36002](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-36002))
* Ensure that Annotate\_rows is always written direct after GTID information, before any table\_map events. Before this patch the event could be written in a random position in the binary log. This change make the place of the Annotate\_rows event predictable.
  * When mixing transactional and not transactional tables in the same transaction, the Annotate rows event was not always written in the case of a rollback. This is now fixed. ([MDEV-37356](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37356))
* ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=MRG\_MyISAM is now properly logged as an DDL. This ensure that the changed MERGE table cannot be used by a slave thread until after the ALTER command has been executed. ([MDEV-37903](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37903))

### Configuration

* Galera galera\_new\_cluster scipt and its systemd interactions was rewritten to avoid selinux errors. This will require the mysql-selinux-1.0.14+ version that is a dependency of the server in RPM+selinux distributions. ([MDEV-37726](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-37726))
